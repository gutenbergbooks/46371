<p class="chaptitle">DECLARATION OF WAR.</p>


<p>There was a large crowd on the Battery in New York
City one hot day in June in the year eighteen-hundred-and-twelve.</p>

<p>Every one was talking and every one was looking out
across the waters of the harbor.</p>

<p>There were pale, anxious faces in that crowd, and side
by side with them were the flushed cheeks of men and
boys whose hearts were fired with patriotic zeal.</p>

<p>Women were looking at their husbands, and young
girls' hearts were throbbing with painful excitement as
they saw the enthusiasm of their sweethearts.</p>

<p>"War, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, the President has aroused at last, and old England
shall be taught another and a final lesson."</p>

<p>It was true.</p>

<p>President James Madison had signed the Declaration of
War against Great Britain.</p>

<p>War!</p>

<p>There were many in that crowd who remembered 1783;
there stood the man who, in his boyhood's days, had
climbed the flagpole and torn down the Union Jack of
England, and in its place had hoisted the Star Spangled
Banner.</p>

<p>Many whose hair was now turning gray had shouldered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the musket and had marched with Washington from victory
to victory.</p>

<p>The war had ended when the British evacuated the city,
but America was not free and independent.</p>

<p>England held the supremacy of the seas.</p>

<p>English vessels entered American ports, and men were
impressed as seamen on the technical ground that they
had never abjured allegiance.</p>

<p>American vessels were boarded on the high seas, and
some of the best men taken away and forced to serve
under the English flag.</p>

<p>There is a limit to forbearance, and the young nation,
whose infancy had scarcely been passed, resolved that it
would be better to die than endure such insults.</p>

<p>War was declared.</p>

<p>It looked like madness.</p>

<p>It was so, if judged by the ordinary rules of national
conduct.</p>

<p>Great Britain was the mistress of the seas.</p>

<p>On the roll of her navy were over a thousand ships,
and eighty-five of the largest were actually in American
ports.</p>

<p>President Madison and his Cabinet did not, however,
intend that the war should be waged on the high seas.</p>

<p>The American ships-of-war were to remain in the harbors
as so many floating batteries for defensive purposes.</p>

<p>In New York Harbor was a small squadron under the
command of Commodore Rodgers.</p>

<p>He heard the rumor that he was not to go out to sea,
and dispatched Captains Bainbridge and Stewart to
Washington to confer with the Secretary of the Navy.</p>

<p>Secretary Paul Hamilton listened attentively to the two
captains, and they thought they had won their case; but
with great courtesy he thanked them, and said that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
President had, with the consent of his Cabinet, decided to
order the ships to remain in the harbors.</p>

<p>Captain Stewart stamped his foot, and with almost
anger, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Sir, you are going to ruin the country; I'll have you
impeached!"</p>

<p>Paul Hamilton smiled.</p>

<p>Off went Stewart to the White House and argued his
case so well that the President put the unsigned order in
his desk, and told the captain he would consider the
matter.</p>

<p>War was declared a few days after that consultation.</p>

<p>Commodore Rodgers was ready to sail, and only
awaited official knowledge of the declaration.</p>

<p>The crowd at the Battery held divergent sentiments.</p>

<p>"It's all very well for Rodgers to take his ships out, but
kin he bring 'em back," asked an old sailor whose face
was tanned by many a summer sun and winter wind; "kin
he bring 'em back? That's what I want to know!"</p>

<p>"You're afraid, Sam Buller, that's what's the matter."</p>

<p>"Durn it! I afraid, younker? I hate John Bull like
pizen, and but that's no reason why I should go an' get
killed and do no good."</p>

<p>"Take no notice of the old grumbler, men. Our commodore
will not only come back, but will bring lots of
British ships as prizes."</p>

<p>The speaker was a boy&mdash;a mere child&mdash;for he had only
just passed his eleventh birthday; but he was dressed in
the full uniform of the United States navy, and ranked as
a midshipman.</p>

<p>"Hark to the baby!"</p>

<p>"Baby! I'd have you know I got my commission two
years ago, and if you doubt it, I ask these gallant men to
attest it. I'm proud of my ship. I'm proud of her captain,
and I'm an officer there. Is it not so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy appealed to the crew of a boat which had just
reached the wooden dock.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir, and as brave an officer as ever carried a
sword."</p>

<p>The midshipman stepped into the boat, the men dipped
their oars, and the crowd watched the boat glide over the
water until the <i>Essex</i>, a thirty-two gun frigate, was
reached.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" asked the old salt who was
known as Sam Buller, "what did I tell you? Going to
war with chits of boys, not old enough to be a cook's
slavey, as officers."</p>

<p>"Say what you like, that boy may not be as strong, but
he is as brave as any man in the service."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you know him, sir?"</p>

<p>"I do. That boy's name is David Glasgow Farragut,
and he has been on the <i>Essex</i> for four years. He is the
adopted son of Captain Porter, and whoever says one
word against that young midshipman will have to answer
to me."</p>

<p>"And who may you be, my hearty?" asked Sam Buller</p>

<p>"I am Captain Stewart of the United States navy; who
are you?"</p>

<p>Captain Stewart did not wait for a reply, but entered
the boat which awaited him and was soon rowed across to
his ship.</p>

<p>Every one knew Charles Stewart's character for bravery,
for in the year 1800, when in command of the
schooner <i>Experiment</i>, he captured the French privateers
<i>Deux Amis</i> and the <i>Diana</i>. In 1804 he commanded the
<i>Siren</i>, and went with the American squadron against
Tripoli, and achieved several victories.</p>

<p>"I only wish I could get on board the <i>Essex</i>. I'd be
pleased to call Farragut my superior," said a young man,
whose build and manner were those of an educated sailor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you?" asked one of the crowd.</p>

<p>"I have tried, but they told me they were full."</p>

<p>"Do you want to fight?"</p>

<p>The inquirer was one whose appearance invited confidence.
He was well dressed, and had a good honest face.</p>

<p>"Fight? Yes, sir; if it be the British I fight against."</p>

<p>"Why are you anxious to fight the British?"</p>

<p>"My grandfather, sir, was with Washington, and was
killed fighting for his country; my father was wounded,
and my elder brother killed. I have been told of those
days, and I have a debt to pay."</p>

<p>"But you do not remember that time."</p>

<p>"No, sir. I am only nineteen years old, and the British
evacuated New York twelve years before I was born."</p>

<p>"Then it is only as you have been educated? You
blush! You need not make me your confidant unless you
like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, sir, for I know you can feel for me."</p>

<p>The two young men had separated from the crowd,
and had walked along the water's edge until they came to
where the Barge Office now stands.</p>

<p>They were alone, or nearly so, as the crowds were
watching the war vessels.</p>

<p>"I had a dear friend who was taken from his home and
impressed."</p>

<p>"Ah! never mind the story now. What say you to
shipping with me?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I would like to be on a man-of-war."</p>

<p>"I see; and you think I cannot ship you on a war vessel.
But if it is fighting you want, I can promise you as
much as you desire. If it is prize money you seek, my
boy, don't go on a warship, but ship with me."</p>

<p>"And, sir, what may be your ship's name?"</p>

<p>The elder man led his companion a little farther up the
dock and pointed out a schooner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"See! there is the ship for you, my boy; look at her!
Isn't she a model?"</p>

<p>She was certainly a beautiful sight as she hoisted her
mainsail and jib and glided off under a breeze so light
that the large ships hardly stirred, with all their sails set.</p>

<p>"She has started."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay; but we can catch her at the Narrows. I like
you, and I want you to ship with me. Will you do so?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come along; you shall have a warm welcome on board
the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>"Is that schooner the famed privateer?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have a <i>lettre de marque</i> from the government.
We shall fight, but if we are taken prisoners we shall be
hanged. On the one hand I promise you plenty of fighting
and lots of prize money, on the other there is the risk of
being hanged."</p>

<p>"I will go with you."</p>

<p>"I knew you would. I came ashore purposely to meet
you."</p>

<p>"To meet me? You do not know me."</p>

<p>"Don't I? Then perhaps I have made a mistake. I
thought you were John Tempest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is my name; but how did you know me, and
why did you want me?"</p>

<p>"You will ship with me?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"Give me your hand. We shall be comrades in many
a fight. I am Captain Harry Vernon of the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE DEPARTURE.</p>


<p>Out in the bay the American fleet was preparing to
depart.</p>

<p>Commodore Rodgers had just heard of the declaration
of war, and he was afraid that the order to detain him in
the harbor would be signed and delivered to him before he
could start.</p>

<p>He called Captains Bainbridge and Stewart and Porter
to the flagship and asked abruptly:</p>

<p>"How long before you can sail?"</p>

<p>"Ready now, sir," was Stewart's answer.</p>

<p>Rodgers was blunt and always spared himself words.</p>

<p>"Do you want to fight on the high seas or skulk like
old hulks in the harbor?" he asked, and added quickly:
"You need not answer. I know you well. Go back, get
ready; we will start within an hour, and once outside
the Narrows, no President's order can reach us."</p>

<p>The captains swung themselves over the side and were
rowed back to their vessels.</p>

<p>It was a pretty sight. Those "wooden walls" of Columbia,
in all the bravery of trimly taut rigging, yards
crossed in mathematically precise order, hulls newly
painted, ports open to reveal the lines of frowning guns,
presented a sight which was enough to rouse the enthusiasm
of every patriot on land.</p>

<p>The fleet under the command of Commodore Rodgers
consisted of the flagship <i>President</i>, carrying forty-four
guns; the <i>Essex</i>, thirty-two, and the <i>Hornet</i>, eighteen.</p>

<p>These three vessels were anchored off the Battery, but
they did not comprise the entire fleet, for over against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
what is now Liberty Island were three more, the <i>United
States</i>, mounting forty-four guns, a sister-ship to the
<i>President</i>; the <i>Congress</i>, thirty-eight, and the <i>Argus</i>, sixteen.</p>

<p>Fifty minutes only elapsed after the conference on the
flagship before the entire fleet was under sail.</p>

<p>"Come, my boys," said Captain Vernon, "we have to
overtake the <i>Lively Bee</i> before she reaches the Narrows,
and it is a long pull."</p>

<p>Vernon took the helm, young Tempest the bow oar, and
a tough old salt the oar next him.</p>

<p>It was not until they were seated that Tempest saw the
face of the sailor next him, and at once took a fancy to
him.</p>

<p>Captain Vernon gave the command in a loud, ringing
voice:</p>

<p>"Oars down! Give way!"</p>

<p>The oars fell into the water with splendid precision, and
the boat made a spurt forward.</p>

<p>"You will find, Mr. Tempest, that on board the <i>Lively
Bee</i> we have such discipline that we move like machines."</p>

<p>All the rowers bent to their work, and the captain
cheered them with words of praise.</p>

<p>At times he would pretend to be angry.</p>

<p>"You lazy lubbers, are you asleep? Come, rouse up,
or we'll never reach the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>The men did pull with more spirit after every outburst
of grumbling or reprimand.</p>

<p>Governor's Island was passed, the little boat was saluted
by the captain of the <i>Essex</i>, and Vernon felt proud.</p>

<p>"Tom Mullen, start us a good rousing chorus&mdash;that
one you sang when we chased the French."</p>

<p>Tempest was surprised, for he had not known that the
new sailor was known to the captain, or had sailed with
him against the French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>The rough old salt, in a voice which had more of the
nature of a fog horn than a human being, started singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Americans, then fly to arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And learn the way to use 'em;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If each man fights to 'fend his rights,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The English can't abuse 'em.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yankee Doodle&mdash;mind the tune&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yankee Doodle Dandy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Britons there's trouble brewin'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We'll spank 'em, hard and handy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All joined in the chorus, and Tempest looked surprised,
for he had all the prejudices of the navy against the lax
discipline of a privateer or merchantman.</p>

<p>"I changed my gaff a little, cap'n, for we ain't a-fightin'
Johnny Crapaud any more, but the redcoats," said Mullen,
well pleased with himself for having inserted the word
English for French in the doggerel.</p>

<p>"You did right, Tom, and if we all fight as well as you
sing we'll come back with our pockets full of chinks and
a lot of British prizes in tow."</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> was still a long way ahead, and Captain
Vernon shouted to the rowers:</p>

<p>"Now my hearties, don't get stiff-backed. Crack the
oars! Now, then, bend away!"</p>

<p>The day was hot. Those on shore were bathed in perspiration.</p>

<p>Had thermometers been so plentiful in the streets then
as they are now they would have told the sweating crowd
that ninety degrees in the shade had been reached.</p>

<p>But if standing still, watching the great war vessels sail
lazily out of the harbor, was hot work, what must those
sailors in the captain's boat have experienced as they
rowed through the waters of the bay at racing speed.</p>

<p>"You lazy lubbers, I guess you think you're in church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
with your wives, and can go to sleep. Rouse up, will
you, and land me on the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>Tempest thought he had never been so hot before. He
was not afraid of work, he expected it.</p>

<p>He had entered as a man before the mast, and he knew
a dog's life was one to be envied when compared with
that of a common seaman.</p>

<p>The most barbarous cruelties were practiced on sailors;
they were not treated to any consideration, and therefore
John Tempest was not surprised at the hard work he had
to endure.</p>

<p>He was ready to drop with the heat and fatigue, but
he would not allow the captain to see he was tired.</p>

<p>The Narrows were reached before the boat overtook
the <i>Lively Bee</i>, and the waters of the Lower Bay were
entered before the captain and his men stood on the deck
of the famous schooner.</p>

<p>The crew saluted the captain, who responded warmly,
and then bade Tempest follow him to the cabin.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE LIEUTENANT'S STORY.</p>


<p>"I know you, John Tempest, better than you know me,"
commenced Captain Vernon, "and before you sign the
ship's log I want to have a talk with you."</p>

<p>Tempest followed, wondering much at the manner and
deference shown to him by the captain of the privateer.</p>

<p>"Sit down, and place yourself outside a stiff glass of
that brandy," said Vernon, helping himself at the same
time to a similar dose.</p>

<p>"You possess a time-honored name, young man, and
have spunk to maintain it. Have you forgotten that you
were on the <i>Essex</i> when the British boarded her and demanded
the surrender of a deserter?</p>

<p>"Your captain ordered the alleged deserter to prove his
citizenship, and he couldn't!"</p>

<p>"But he gave his word," said Tempest.</p>

<p>"Yes, but who believes a man's word in such a case?"</p>

<p>"How do you know all this? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Captain Vernon, of the good privateer <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, but how did you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me finish. Your captain agreed to give up the
sailor, whose name was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Vernon hesitated as though he would have liked Tempest
to have finished the sentence.</p>

<p>Tempest remained silent, and his captain continued:</p>

<p>"His name was Vincent Decatur."</p>

<p>"You are right, captain, though that was not the name
in the ship's books."</p>

<p>"No, he was known on board as James Vincent. He
had good reasons for changing his name: Decatur went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
below to get his kit. The British officer and squad of
marines waited him on deck.</p>

<p>"Decatur saw an ax on the carpenter's bench as he
passed. With only a moment's hesitation he seized it in
his right hand, and with one blow cut off the left. It
was then that you, John Tempest, junior officer on board
the U. S. frigate <i>Essex</i>, saw the deed, and congratulated
the man on his bravery.</p>

<p>"Decatur went on deck carrying the severed hand with
him. He presented himself before the British officer,
maimed and useless as a sailor for life.</p>

<p>"He showed his bleeding wrist to the officer, and, almost
faint with loss of blood, he managed to say:</p>

<p>"'Sir, I swore I would never serve under the English
flag, or recognize it except as the flag of an enemy. My
own captain has deserted me. I am an American born,
and my severed hand will show how I have kept my oath.'
Then you, Ensign Tempest, called for three cheers for the
brave American sailor. The crew and marines on the
<i>Essex</i> responded to the call, and the cheers ascended
through the rigging. Captain Porter intimated that your
influence in the service would not be good, and&mdash;to put it
mildly&mdash;asked you to resign your commission. The men
would have stood by you, but you knew disobedience to
the captain's will was mutiny, and you offered your resignation,
which was accepted. There was one who did
plead for you&mdash;Cadet Midshipman Farragut. But Porter
was inexorable, and you became a landsman."</p>

<p>"How do you know all this?"</p>

<p>"I have not yet finished; hear me through and we shall
better understand each other."</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> was skimming through the water at
the rate of four knots an hour, but so well proportioned
was she that the motion was almost imperceptible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take another glass of brandy, Tempest."</p>

<p>"No, captain, I have sea legs, but a landsman's head,
and cannot stand much grog."</p>

<p>"You had not been on shore long before you again met
Vincent Decatur. He was crippled for life, but was
happier than had he been compelled to sail under the
British flag.</p>

<p>"You visited him&mdash;ah, your face tells me that I am
right&mdash;you felt a strange desire to distinguish yourself,
not because of patriotism altogether, but the bright eyes
of Bertha Decatur shone into your very soul. She would
marry none who deserted his country in the hour of need.
The man she would honor was one who fought for his
country. You heard this and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shipped on a privateer," added Tempest, almost sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Yes, shipped on the neatest, trimmest, fastest schooner
afloat, on the <i>Lively Bee</i>, which shall sting so often and
so deeply that all America shall respect its crew."</p>

<p>"How did you learn all you have told me?"</p>

<p>Captain Vernon laughed merrily, and looked at the
young ensign almost quizzically.</p>

<p>"You would like to know?"</p>

<p>"I am burning with curiosity."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you. I heard the story partly from
Midshipman Farragut&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know him?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"And yet when Buller was reviling him at the Battery
you did not defend him."</p>

<p>"No! It would have been an impertinence for a privateer
captain to defend a naval officer."</p>

<p>"But young Farragut did not know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bertha Decatur, no; but I do, and she sang your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
praises so often that I wanted to find you. Farragut
quietly pointed you out in the crowd at the Battery, and&mdash;well,
here you are."</p>

<p>"A man before the mast."</p>

<p>"No. You were ensign in the navy, where promotion is
slow; you shall be first officer on the <i>Lively Bee</i>. Will
you accept?"</p>

<p>"How can I thank you?"</p>

<p>"By doing your duty. I am proud to have you, Tempest,
and I don't think you will ever rue the day you became
first officer on the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>"I accept your generous offer."</p>

<p>"You have done well. I am a good skipper, I can steer
a vessel as well as any man, and I can fight, but sometimes
a little science which you naval fellows have is very
useful. I shall expect you to be as ardent an enemy of the
British as I am. Show no quarter, have no mercy, send
every British ship to Davy Jones' locker if you can't take
it captive. Let your motto be, as mine is, eternal hatred
to British rule."</p>

<p>"I will swear it if necessary."</p>

<p>"No, Tempest, the word of an honest man is all I need.
Be watchful."</p>

<p>"I will make no boast, captain, but I think you will find
I can do without food or sleep as long as any man, and
my vigilance shall never give you a moment's uneasiness."</p>

<p>"I know it. Now, there is another thing. Although
the <i>Lively Bee</i> is a privateer, we are most punctilious
about dress. We are uniformed when at sea."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In yonder room, which will be yours, you will find a
first officer's uniform, which, if I mistake not, will be a
fair fit for you. If it wants altering, we have an excellent
tailor on board."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"How thoughtful you are, captain."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the compliment. Now go and dress,
and I will introduce you to your brother officers."</p>

<p>John Tempest was surprised at the size and comfort
of his stateroom.</p>

<p>It was far superior to the one he occupied on the <i>Essex</i>.</p>

<p>He thought it was fit for a lady's bower, and as he
thought it he remembered Bertha, and his love for her.</p>

<p>"What will she say of my becoming a privateer?" he
asked himself. "Surely the risk is enough. If I am captured,
I shall be hanged. If I am shot, I shall die for my
country. If Farragut recognizes my captain, why should
I be ashamed of him? I will do my duty, and will win
Bertha."</p>

<p>He dressed in the uniform, and looked as handsome a
privateer as ever walked a deck.</p>

<p>When he stepped up the companionway to the deck, he
was met by the captain.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Lieutenant Tempest," he said, grasping the
young officer's hand.</p>

<p>Turning to the officers, he said in his usual hearty
manner:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, this is Lieutenant Tempest, my first officer,
an able seaman, as I can vouch, an honest man, and an
inveterate hater of England. For ten generations his
family has been noted for its patriotism, and the <i>Lively
Bee</i> will have the advantage of his name, fame and honor.
Lieutenant Tempest, Mr. Scarron and Mr. Webster. I
hope you will all be good friends."</p>

<p>Scarron and Webster were typical sailors.</p>

<p>Blunt almost to uncouthness, they looked just what they
were&mdash;able seamen, good fighters and not overburdened
with education or politeness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was first officer on a whaler," said Scarron as he
further introduced himself.</p>

<p>"And I was a merchant skipper till the French seized
my ship and I paid away every cent I had as ransom.
Now I'm a privateer and ready to fight."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE CHALLENGE.</p>


<p>Captain Vernon was one of the most uneasy men living.</p>

<p>He could not keep still.</p>

<p>Action was the watchword of his life.</p>

<p>He was a handsome man, young&mdash;that is, he had not
reached his fortieth year&mdash;straight as an arrow, with
firmness imprinted on every feature.</p>

<p>He could not have lived on a slow boat. He would
have gone crazy.</p>

<p>Had he been on a man-of-war crawling along at two
knots an hour, he would most likely have deserted.</p>

<p>On the <i>Lively Bee</i> he was the most active man.</p>

<p>He owned the vessel, and was proud of it.</p>

<p>When there was a rumor of war, he hurried to Washington
and applied for a <i>lettre de marque</i>.</p>

<p>For those of our readers who do not understand the
expression, we explain that a letter of marque gave permission
to the owner of a private vessel to make war on
another nation. Without this letter of authority, such
war would be piracy. All nations, at the time of the war
of 1812, issued letters of marque, and recognized the
privateers as belligerents, often however ignoring the
authority in the case of prisoners, and hanging the officers
as pirates.</p>

<p>Captain Vernon had two objects to serve in his war on
the English. He hated the British, and he wanted to enrich
himself by prize money.</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> was outside Sandy Hook, and was making
nearly five knots an hour.</p>

<p>Every man on board had to work at racehorse speed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
for the captain was always on the alert. Everything and
everybody about him must be the fastest and best possible.</p>

<p>Although the war ships had started almost as soon as
the privateer, they were nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>"Sail ho!"</p>

<p>The alarm was given by Scarron.</p>

<p>"Whereaway?"</p>

<p>"I see it, captain," said Tempest, pointing to a white
speck on the horizon.</p>

<p>The captain took the glass and looked long and earnestly
in the direction.</p>

<p>"She is in cruising canvas only. Most probably a merchantman,"
he said, as he handed the glass to Tempest.</p>

<p>"No, captain, she is a war ship, and British at that."</p>

<p>"Think so?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet my last dollar she's British, but she's too big
for us to tackle."</p>

<p>Tempest paced the deck uneasily.</p>

<p>Here was a British war ship almost within fighting distance,
and she was to be allowed to escape.</p>

<p>"Captain, a word with you."</p>

<p>"What is it, Tempest?"</p>

<p>"Have you a long-range gun on board?"</p>

<p>"A thirty-four pounder. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I would like to draw closer to that Britisher
and give her a shot."</p>

<p>"Is not that a dangerous game?"</p>

<p>"It is a risk. I think she only carries light-weight guns,
perhaps twelve-pounders."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Instinct. But apart from that feeling, you will find she
is a French-rigged frigate, and they seldom carry anything
above a twelve-pounder."</p>

<p>"You can take the risk if you like, Tempest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"May I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you will be responsible for the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>It was a terrible responsibility for the young man to
take, but there was something about him which inspired
confidence, and Captain Vernon wanted to see of what
mettle the man was made.</p>

<p>Orders were given, and the little schooner sailed direct
for the big wars-man.</p>

<p>"Captain, we are within gunshot distance. What shall
we do?"</p>

<p>Vernon walked aft, saying as he did so:</p>

<p>"You took the responsibility; do the best you can."</p>

<p>"Very well, captain."</p>

<p>On went the schooner until it was so close that the big
Britisher seemed to shut out all view of the horizon.</p>

<p>"Scarron! we are going to beat to quarters."</p>

<p>"Sir! Mr. Tempest, sir!"</p>

<p>"I said we were going to beat to quarters. Have you
any objections?"</p>

<p>"Seems to me we'll die within sight of New York anyway,"
muttered Scarron.</p>

<p>"Very likely," Tempest calmly replied. "All the same,
we shall fight that vessel."</p>

<p>Instead of waiting for Scarron to give the order to the
drummer, Tempest did it himself.</p>

<p>No sooner had the roll of the drum been wafted across
the waters than there was a change manifest in the attitude
of the cruiser.</p>

<p>The crew were now on the alert, and an answering roll
of the drum told the little schooner that the Britisher accepted
the challenge.</p>

<p>It was perfectly safe to do so.</p>

<p>What chance had a little privateer against a trim, well-built
war cruiser?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Tempest had the long gun loaded, and he took sight
himself.</p>

<p>The Britisher ran up the Union Jack as a defiance, an
act answered by the raising of the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>No one on board the cruiser had any idea that the privateer
could carry so heavy a gun as a thirty-four-pounder.</p>

<p>The gun was ready, the match applied.</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> quivered and shook, but that was all.</p>

<p>The shot tore through the rigging, plowing along the
deck of the cruiser, and disabling or killing a dozen men.</p>

<p>A broadside was fired, but the shots fell short of the
<i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>It was as Tempest thought&mdash;she had only light guns.</p>

<p>One more shot was fired by the young lieutenant, and a
hole was bored in the bow of the cruiser.</p>

<p>"We have taught her a lesson, captain, but we cannot
fight her."</p>

<p>"No; what do you intend doing?"</p>

<p>"The fleet is near."</p>

<p>"I see; I think I understand."</p>

<p>Captain Vernon walked down to his cabin, leaving all
command in the hands of his young officer.</p>

<p>"He has spunk, and I like him; he has grit and will
pull through," he said, as he threw himself down on the
seat.</p>

<p>Tempest lowered the Stars and Stripes, and the Britisher
took it, as he intended, as a sign of surrender.</p>

<p>The cruiser now showed itself plainly, and its name,
the <i>Belvidera</i>, was discernible through the glass.</p>

<p>"I thought she was French," said Tempest.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, sir?" asked Scarron. "Surrender?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I shall never surrender until it is to Death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Give orders; let the <i>Lively Bee</i> show her heels to the
Britisher, quick, or we may get raked with shot."</p>

<p>On sped the privateer, and the cruiser followed quickly
after her.</p>

<p>Then the <i>Lively Bee</i> tacked, and the <i>Belvidera</i> saw,
when almost too late, that she had been led nearly within
gunshot of Commodore Rodgers' flagship, the <i>President</i>.</p>

<p>Both vessels began preparing for a test of skillful
marksmanship, and for that most interesting of all engagements&mdash;a
naval duel.</p>

<p>On the <i>Belvidera</i> the English sailors were busily engaged
in shifting long eighteens and carronades to the
stern, making a battery of stern-chasers mounting four
guns.</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> watched the preparations, and occasionally
sent a shot tearing across the <i>Belvidera's</i> deck, throwing
the crew into confusion.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE CHASE.</p>


<p>A fresh breeze was blowing when the American fleet
began the chase after the <i>Belvidera</i>.</p>

<p>In a few hours the <i>President</i> had drawn away from
the fleet, and was forging ahead.</p>

<p>Then the little <i>Wasp</i>, as lively as the insect after which
it was named, came closely after.</p>

<p>The big <i>United States</i> followed next, with the <i>Essex</i> in
good position.</p>

<p>Then commenced a contest of speed between the representative
vessels of the two greatest nations on earth.</p>

<p>The English ship was trying to get away, the American
endeavoring to catch her.</p>

<p>The <i>Belvidera</i> was a swift vessel, but it had to maneuver
considerably, for the <i>Wasp</i> was trying to get into
the offing to prevent escape, and the <i>Lively Bee</i> was keeping
up the excitement by sending a shot at intervals, whenever
the Britisher got within safe distance.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock in the afternoon when Commodore
Rodgers leaped into the rigging to take another view of
his adversary.</p>

<p>He was well satisfied.</p>

<p>His heart beat with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>War had been declared, and he was to be the one to
fire the first shot at the British power on the seas.</p>

<p>For although the privateer had done effectual work, the
navy did not give it credit.</p>

<p>Rodgers went to the bow of the <i>President</i> and sighted
the gun himself.</p>

<p>His shot was a good one, hulling the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Vernon saw it through his glass and he cried
out loudly:</p>

<p>"Bravo, Rodgers! Give him another!"</p>

<p>A second shot followed before the <i>Belvidera</i> could
reply.</p>

<p>The American was superior in gunning, and every shot
told.</p>

<p>A third shot from the <i>President</i> broke off the muzzle
of one of the <i>Belvidera's</i> stern-chasers, while another shot
crashed into the stern of the chase, killing two men and
wounding several others.</p>

<p>The men on the <i>Belvidera</i> were now all excitement.</p>

<p>Captain Byron bit his lips in anger.</p>

<p>He had sighted the guns himself, but had done no damage
to the American.</p>

<p>He ordered two long eighteen-pounders on the main
deck to the stern, and two thirty-two-pound carronades on
the quarter deck.</p>

<p>With these he kept up an incessant fire, many shots being
effective.</p>

<p>The rigging of the <i>President</i> was cut in many places,
and one midshipman was killed.</p>

<p>While the excitement was at its height a young midshipman
on the <i>President</i>, a boy whose years could not
have exceeded ten, performed a most daring feat.</p>

<p>A gun was sighted at the <i>Belvidera</i>, but the gunner
was stricken down as he was in the act of firing.</p>

<p>The boy saw it and with patriotic fervor, shouted:</p>

<p>"I'll have one shot at the rascals anyway."</p>

<p>But he could find no match with which to fire the gun.</p>

<p>Not to be daunted, he rushed to the galley and picking
up a live coal in his fingers, he hurried with it, regardless
of the intense pain, and placed it on the priming.</p>

<p>Instantly the report showed that he had fulfilled his
threat, and had fired one shot at the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>His thumb and finger were burned to the bones, but he
was happy.</p>

<p>And the shot was an effective one.</p>

<p>A lieutenant and two marines were killed by it as it tore
its way along the deck.</p>

<p>The chase continued for another hour, the flagship
leading all the others, the <i>Lively Bee</i> watching the chase,
but taking no part just then.</p>

<p>It was only a question of a few hours when the <i>President</i>
would overtake the English ship.</p>

<p>But just when victory was in sight a loud explosion
startled everybody, and directed the attention of the whole
fleet to the <i>President</i>.</p>

<p>Commodore Rodgers had again sighted his heavy gun,
which was getting so hot that he almost deemed it unsafe
to load it.</p>

<p>"One more shot," he cried, as he applied the match.</p>

<p>A cloud of smoke hung over the <i>President</i> as the noise
of the report cleared away.</p>

<p>In firing that shot the gun had burst with a terrific
report, the flying fragments killing or wounding sixteen
men.</p>

<p>The commodore was thrown high into the air, and fell
heavily on the deck, suffering a severe fracture of his leg.</p>

<p>Panic set in.</p>

<p>Some of the sailors were for hauling down the flag, but
they were only raw recruits, and were quickly overpowered
by the older men.</p>

<p>The accident caused a cessation of the firing for a time,
and the <i>Belvidera</i> took advantage of it to show her heels.</p>

<p>"Follow her! Rake her with shot and shell!" shouted
the wounded commodore. "Don't let her escape!"</p>

<p>But the Britisher had lightened herself.</p>

<p>Her anchors and boats were cut away and fourteen
tons of water were thrown overboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus lightened, she began to draw away from the <i>President</i>.</p>

<p>The latter yawed several times, and let fly full broadsides
at the escaping cruiser.</p>

<p>The shot rattled among the spars of the <i>Belvidera</i>, but
the nimble topmen quickly repaired all damages; and the
British ship increased the distance between herself and
the American fleet.</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> followed at a safe distance.</p>

<p>"What do you think now, Tempest?" asked Captain
Vernon.</p>

<p>"I'd humble that proud Briton if I had my way," answered
the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Can we do it?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to try."</p>

<p>"Do as you please; the <i>Lively Bee</i> shall be under your
orders," answered Captain Vernon, and young Tempest
raised his hand to heaven, while from his lips there arose
a cry, which was like the registering of a solemn oath.</p>

<p>"Before heaven I swear my hand shall know no rest,
my life no pleasure, until the British acknowledge our
right to liberty!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" responded Vernon.</p>

<p>And the <i>Lively Bee</i> started in the darkness of night in
the wake of the <i>Belvidera</i>.</p>

<p>But in the night a storm arose; the thunder shook the
schooner, making every timber creak and groan like a
living thing in anguish.</p>

<p>The lightning played about the rigging, and Captain
Vernon wrung his hands in despair.</p>

<p>"Can she live through it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, captain, for the <i>Lively Bee</i> has a glorious work
to do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heaven grant you are right, Tempest, for she is the
pride of my heart."</p>

<p>The waves dashed over her deck; the thunders roared
like ten thousand parks of artillery; and men who had
only used the name of the Creator in blasphemy prayed
to Him for succor and safety.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">STORM AT SEA.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">"The wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Increased at night until it blew a gale;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And though 'twas not much to a naval mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some landsmen would have looked a little pale.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wind blew still more fresh; as it grew late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A squall came on, and some guns broke loose;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A gust&mdash;which all descriptive power transcends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid with one blast the ship on her beam-ends."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>There was something sublime in Harry Vernon's declaration:</p>

<p>"She must weather the gale, for the <i>Lively Bee</i> has
work to do."</p>

<p>But what a storm she encountered! Captain Vernon
thought of the big war ships, and feared for them.</p>

<p>He strained his ears to listen for the solemn booming
of the signal gun of some vessel in distress.</p>

<p>His fears were more for the others than for his own
tight little craft.</p>

<p>"The water is coming fast in the hold," said Scarron.</p>

<p>"All hands to the pumps, then!"</p>

<p>The men worked with a will.</p>

<p>They were accustomed to danger, and they did not
magnify their trouble.</p>

<p>But it was an anxious night.</p>

<p>Not a star illumined the sky.</p>

<p>Not one glimmer of light could be seen.</p>

<p>Angry waves broke over the deck of the <i>Lively Bee</i>,
and the boards creaked and groaned like living things.</p>

<p>The masts bent beneath the weight of rigging, and
every moment it was feared that they would go over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tempest, are you afraid?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"No, sir; but if I have to die soon, I'd rather it be in a
struggle with an English ship."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay; so would I. But we must be ready, for death
won't wait our pleasure."</p>

<p>"You do not think," and Tempest paused; he did not
like to shape his thoughts in words.</p>

<p>"I think the <i>Lively Bee</i> will weather the storm, but I
may not."</p>

<p>"You are low-spirited. Oh!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was natural. A sudden gust had
swept across the deck, the waves had broken with terrific
force, and not one but thought his last hour had come.</p>

<p>The calm which followed saw the captain at the tiller.</p>

<p>"All's well, sir," asserted the steersman.</p>

<p>"We can stand it here, if the water does not gain on
us."</p>

<p>"The <i>Lively Bee</i> can stand it, I think."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir; she's the tautest boat I ever sailed in. But
we're in for dirty weather afore morn."</p>

<p>Captain Vernon walked forward and again spoke to
Tempest.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tempest, I want you to take an oath."</p>

<p>"Captain!"</p>

<p>"Yes, a solemn oath. We are engaged in fighting an
enemy which claims to be empress of the seas. Will you
swear that, whatever happens to me, you will stay by the
<i>Lively Bee</i> as long as her timbers hold together, or until
our flag is acknowledged on the ocean as well as on land?"</p>

<p>"I swear it, Vernon!"</p>

<p>"I thought you would. I have made my will; the <i>Lively
Bee</i> will be under your command if anything happens to
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why so despondent? You do not think we shall go
down in the gale?"</p>

<p>"No, but ours is a venturesome life, and I like to get
things in order."</p>

<p>"Captain, the water is gaining on us."</p>

<p>"Pump away, lads; the back of the storm is broken."</p>

<p>Tempest went to the pumps, and saw one of the men
whose arms were tired, and whose whole body showed
exhaustion.</p>

<p>"Stand away, Mike; let me have a turn for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"You, sir? You're a gentleman."</p>

<p>"I am a sailor, Mike, and can work as well as fight or
give orders."</p>

<p>The rough seaman looked at the lieutenant and could
scarcely believe his senses.</p>

<p>"No, no, sir; this 'ere work is not for the likes of you."</p>

<p>"Stand aside and rest a bit; I'll call you when I'm
tired."</p>

<p>"Which'll be precious soon, I'll warrant me," growled
Zeke Patten, a surly, discontented man.</p>

<p>"You hold your tongue unless you can be civil, Zeke,"
said Mullen, "or I'll make you."</p>

<p>Tempest heard both remarks, but did not let it be seen.</p>

<p>He took Mike's place and worked with an energy they
had not counted on.</p>

<p>"Why don't you sing, boys?" he asked; "the work is so
much easier."</p>

<p>"Can't get our breath then."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll try."</p>

<p>And Lieutenant Tempest began singing an impromptu
doggerel, which the sailors thought the most perfect
poetry ever written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The <i>Lively Bee</i> will weather the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Yoho! my boys! yoho!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she's taut and trim and spick and span,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Yoho! my boys! yoho!<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>With what zest they worked! The water was diminished
in the hold, and the <i>Lively Bee</i> was weathering the
storm splendidly.</p>

<p>But the storm was not over. It seemed as though the
elements were tired and had need of a short respite, for
there was a lull and the men breathed again, glad that
they would get a rest.</p>

<p>Mike had again taken his place at the pump, Zeke and
Mullen had been replaced by others, and the pumps gained
on the water splendidly.</p>

<p>Suddenly a flash of lightning darted along the sky,
making the green billows as bright as in daytime.</p>

<p>Like a glittering serpent it flashed across, and simultaneously
the air was rent with a report so loud that the
<i>Lively Bee</i> quivered and shook as though it had been an
animate being and was afraid of the storm.</p>

<p>There was such a lull and awful stillness that the helmsman
had no control of the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>"Hard-a-weather&mdash;&mdash;" shouted the captain; "hard-up,
for your life!"</p>

<p>He sprang to the helm, but the head of the schooner
remained immovable in the same direction.</p>

<p>Vernon watched the approaching hurricane.</p>

<p>His experience told him that it was coming again with
redoubled fury.</p>

<p>The lightning flashes showed them a glimpse of the
storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything was done to save the schooner which experienced
seamanship could suggest.</p>

<p>"Head her off," cried the captain, "or we shall capsize!"</p>

<p>Onward came the hurricane, ploughing up the sea,
which boiled and foamed and roared before it, a moving
spasm of awful surge.</p>

<p>"Look to yourself, captain!" shouted Tempest, and the
words died away on the wind just as the wild waters
leaped over the deck with the thunderous roar and fury
of a cataract.</p>

<p>The weather main-chains were wrenched like threads,
with all their rigging, from the sides of the vessel; and
the main mast, bending like a cane, broke off with a loud
crash close to the deck.</p>

<p>It was an awful moment.</p>

<p>A wild cry arose from the sailors, but it was drowned in
the roar of the waters and the thunder of the gale.</p>

<p>The lightning flashed and leaped about like phantasmagoric
demons, as if mocking the sailors in their frantic
dread.</p>

<p>"Cut away the foremast&mdash;look lively, men!"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tempest had been prepared for this order,
and with an ax severed the distended shrouds, which flew
wildly in the air, lashing the sea as they fell.</p>

<p>The remaining straps parted with sharp reports before
the ax descended, and the unsustained mast, after a few
vigorous blows by the daring hand of the young officer,
snapped off a few feet from the deck.</p>

<p>A large wave lifted it like a straw and bore it away to
leeward.</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i>&mdash;a wreck&mdash;drifted about on the billows.</p>

<p>Captain Vernon almost sobbed as he thought of her.</p>

<p>The heavens were as black as raven wings, the lightning
played across them in streams of fire, the water was
phosphorescently illuminated, while great masses of water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
swollen into gigantic billows, burst into glittering foam
over the deck.</p>

<p>"We are lost," cried Mike. "Holy Mary, have mercy,"
Zeke blasphemed, and then with all the superstition of his
class declared that there was a Jonah aboard.</p>

<p>The captain heard him.</p>

<p>"What of it?" he cried. "We can't find the Jonah in
this storm."</p>

<p>"I kin," answered the man.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is yourself, Zeke; I remember we were
nearly wrecked off Cape Cod the last time you were with
me."</p>

<p>Vernon had turned the tables on the man, who now
shivered with fear.</p>

<p>"Doan't say that, cap'n, or they'll throw me overboard."</p>

<p>Zeke had no more to say about Jonahs, and while he
blasphemed the others prayed.</p>

<p>The storm ceased its anger, the winds were calmed
down, the furious billows gradually subsided, and the
<i>Lively Bee</i> drifted along as steadily as on a river.</p>

<p>When morning came all eyes were strained for a sail.</p>

<p>Signals of distress were made, and soon in the far distance
an answer was made.</p>

<p>A brave-looking ship was seen, and soon a boat was
lowered to go to the assistance of the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>"What flag?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>Tempest was looking through his glass at the distant
ship.</p>

<p>"I cannot see, but she is a war ship."</p>

<p>Captain Vernon folded his arms and waited.</p>

<p>"If she floats the British flag I accept no aid. If she
wants to take us prisoners, those of you who are willing,
can go, but for myself, I shall fire the magazine and blow
up the <i>Lively Bee</i> and myself as well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall stay by your side, captain," said Tempest.</p>

<p>"So say all of us," shouted Mullen.</p>

<p>"Captain!" said Tempest.</p>

<p>It was a sudden shout, and almost startled Vernon.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mr. Tempest?"</p>

<p>"The flag&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Is ours."</p>

<p>"God be praised! Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and&mdash;the boat&mdash;is commanded by&mdash;Mr. Farragut."</p>

<p>"Then the ship is the <i>Essex</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE ESSEX.</p>


<p>"Ship ahoy!" shouted Midshipman David Farragut.</p>

<p>The answer was given by Captain Vernon.</p>

<p>"What ship?" asked Farragut.</p>

<p>"The <i>Lively Bee</i> of Boston."</p>

<p>"Captain Harry Vernon?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir."</p>

<p>The boat was too far away as yet for the men to be
recognized by the eye, unaided by a glass, and the questions
were given in a loud voice through the speaking
horn.</p>

<p>Soon the boat was alongside, and young Farragut
swung himself up the chains to the deck.</p>

<p>David Farragut&mdash;the naval hero of the century&mdash;was
at that time a bright lad eleven years old.</p>

<p>But, boy as he was, he ordered the old tars about, and
was efficient as an officer.</p>

<p>"We feared it might be a British vessel which sighted
us," said Captain Vernon.</p>

<p>But Farragut did not notice, his eyes were fixed forward
where Tempest was standing.</p>

<p>"Blow me! but isn't that young man Ensign Tempest?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"It is Lieutenant John Tempest," answered Vernon.</p>

<p>"Blow me! but it seems promotion is rapid on a privateer.
Tempest!"</p>

<p>As Farragut shouted the name, the young man turned,
his face crimson, for he remembered that the last time he
had met the midshipman both were officers of the same
ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Farragut."</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity! How long have I been mister? Am I
not still David to you?"</p>

<p>"I hope so?"</p>

<p>"Zounds, man! But your new dignity has made you
proud. Don't you ever think of the capers we used to cut
up on the <i>Essex</i>? But that was before I was a midshipman."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember. Those were happy days. I fear me,
though, I am a Jonah."</p>

<p>Farragut laughed and gave Tempest a hearty smack
on the back, making him wince.</p>

<p>"How did you weather the storm?" asked Vernon.</p>

<p>"We were on the fringe of it. Quite local, you know,
so we did not suffer much."</p>

<p>"Did you fall in with the enemy?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, but we are ready;" and young Farragut had
started on a theme of which he never grew tired.</p>

<p>"Every day," he said, "the crew exercise at the great
guns, small arms, and single stick. Then, they have been
so thoroughly trained as boarders that every man is prepared
for such an emergency, with his cutlass as sharp
as a razor, his dirk made out of a file, and a good pistol.
Zounds, Tempest, and you, too, captain, but I hope we
shall whet our blades soon."</p>

<p>Vernon sighed.</p>

<p>"What do you want us to do? Is the <i>Lively Bee</i> a castaway?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. If we can get to port, a week will make her
as good as ever."</p>

<p>"Then you want to be towed back?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere will do."</p>

<p>"Captain, come back with me to the <i>Essex</i>, and Captain
Porter will arrange with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>In less than two hours the <i>Lively Bee</i> was being towed
by the <i>Essex</i>.</p>

<p>Captain Vernon looked to his guns and ammunition,
and to his great satisfaction found that everything was
safe and his powder dry.</p>

<p>He rigged up a mast, and before the end of the next
day told Captain Porter he was in no particular hurry
about making port, that a few days would make but little
difference.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say that, Vernon, for I believe
we shall have a chance to smell powder within the next
forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>"Then I would not think of taking you out of your
way."</p>

<p>The <i>Essex</i> was intended for a victor.</p>

<p>Its commander was a fighter, and as good a tactician as
ever walked the deck of a man-of-war.</p>

<p>During the calm he ordered the <i>Essex</i> to be disguised.</p>

<p>The top-gallant masts were housed, the ports of the
gun deck closed in, and her usually trim cordage and nicely-squared
yards were set in a way that only the most
shiftless of merchant skippers would tolerate.</p>

<p>Captain Vernon paced the deck of the <i>Lively Bee</i> impatiently.</p>

<p>He did not understand Porter's tactics, and there was
nothing jarred more upon his seaman instincts than a
slovenly-set ship.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," said Tempest. "Porter has set a trap for
the British, and we shall have some hard fighting before
long."</p>

<p>And the young officer was right.</p>

<p>Porter sent for Vernon.</p>

<p>"Can you stand alone for a few days?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if need be."</p>

<p>"It will be better. Have your guns ready, but concealed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
we will play the part of merchantmen and give
the enemy fits."</p>

<p>"Sail ho!" exclaimed the <i>Bee's</i> lookout.</p>

<p>"Where away?"</p>

<p>"To windward."</p>

<p>The news was signaled to the <i>Essex</i>, and it was soon
known that a British war ship was bearing down on the
<i>Essex</i>.</p>

<p>Commander Porter carried his acting still further.</p>

<p>Instead of the crowd of agile sailors that spring into
the rigging of a man-of-war at the order to make sail,
only a mere handful were ordered by the captain to set
with the greatest awkwardness all the sail the <i>Essex</i> could
carry.</p>

<p>Then two long heavy cables were quietly lowered over
the stern, and dragging through the water, retarded the
ship's progress.</p>

<p>The Britisher thought he had fallen in with a heavy
merchantman which was making frantic efforts to escape.</p>

<p>When the man-of-war was near enough to perceive
the signals, the <i>Essex</i> warned the <i>Lively Bee</i> to fly before
the wind out of the way of the enemy.</p>

<p>Vernon entered into the spirit of the thing, and instead
of escaping, caused the schooner to drag along as though
heavily freighted.</p>

<p>On the deck of the <i>Essex</i> the few sailors seemed excited
and flurried, and the Britisher did not know that every
action was assumed.</p>

<p>Had the commander of the English ship been gifted
with second sight he would have seen behind those closed
ports a roomy gun deck glistening with that whiteness
seen only on the decks of a well-ordered war ship.</p>

<p>Down either side of the deck stretched a row of heavy
carronades, each with its crew of gunners grouped about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the breach, and each shotted and primed ready for the
opening volley.</p>

<p>On a man-of-war in time of action no one can be idle.</p>

<p>Hence on this occasion, from the magazine amidships
to the gun deck, there reached a line of stewards, cooks,
waiters and extra deck hands, ready to pass up cartridges.</p>

<p>Bare-footed boys, stripped naked to the waist, were
skurrying about the deck.</p>

<p>These were the "powder-monkeys," whose duty it
would be, when the firing began, to take the cartridges
from the line of powder passers and carry them to the
guns.</p>

<p>On the spar deck only a few sailors and officers were
visible to the enemy.</p>

<p>But under the taffrail lay crouched scores of jackies,
wearing blue uniforms, and smooth-faced middies and
veteran lieutenants, ready at the word of command to
spring into the rigging, or to swarm over the side and
board the enemy should the gunwales of the vessels touch.</p>

<p>The English man-of-war knew nothing of all this preparation.</p>

<p>The British captain was exultant and hoisted a flag
bearing a large figure "7," meaning that his ship had captured
that number of American merchantmen.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the signal, "Haul too," was raised,
but perhaps the Americans did not understand it, so the
Britisher fired a gun.</p>

<p>Still no notice was taken, but the <i>Essex</i> gave the appearance
of renewed exertion to escape, while the <i>Lively
Bee</i> kept signaling for assistance. The two vessels were
near enough for the most minute signals to be understood,
and the Britisher declared that he would add two more
prizes to his conquests before the day was out, meaning
the <i>Essex</i> and the <i>Bee</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Three ringing cheers were given by the British crew,
and the Union Jack was run up the mast.</p>

<p>At the same time a broadside was fired at the <i>Essex</i>.</p>

<p>In an instant the ports of the sham merchantman were
knocked out; and, with warlike thunder, the heavy carronades
hurled their ponderous shots against the side of
the war ship. Before the Britisher could reply the <i>Lively
Bee</i> had sent a shot careening over the enemy's deck, killing
the first lieutenant and two of the men. The English
ship replied but feebly. The men of the <i>Essex</i> and <i>Lively
Bee</i> fired too quickly and too accurately for much resistance,
and in less than eight minutes after the engagement
opened the British hauled down their flag.</p>

<p>The captured ship proved to be the sloop-of-war <i>Alert</i>,
mounting twenty eighteen-pound carronades.</p>

<p>The boarding officer found her badly cut up, and seven
feet of water in the hold. The officers were sent on board
the <i>Essex</i>, and the <i>Alert</i> taken in tow.</p>

<p>The victory was complete, but hardly one to be exultant
over, as the <i>Essex</i> was superior both in size and armaments
to the <i>Alert</i>. However, the <i>Essex</i> has the honor of
having the first British war ship.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SCENTING MUTINY.</p>


<p>The <i>Essex</i> did not keep the <i>Alert</i> long.</p>

<p>It was troublesome to tow such a vessel any distance,
and the <i>Lively Bee</i> had the first claim, as it was not quite
seaworthy.</p>

<p>But while Captain Porter was deliberating what to do
with his capture, an event occurred to hasten his resolve.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Lively Bee</i> were very friendly with the
men of the <i>Essex</i>, and the same feeling was entertained
by the officers.</p>

<p>With one exception. For reasons we have already
given, John Tempest was not welcomed on board the
<i>Essex</i>.</p>

<p>The crew would have lionized him, but Captain Porter
could not well receive him.</p>

<p>Middie Farragut was always finding excuses for visiting
the <i>Lively Bee</i>, for he was fond of the company of
Tempest.</p>

<p>On the third day after the capture of the <i>Alert</i>, the two
young men&mdash;for man we must call Farragut, though not
one in years&mdash;were seated in the <i>Bee's</i> cabin when Tempest
whispered suddenly:</p>

<p>"You ought to be careful of those prisoners."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"They are numerous, and you give them free run of
the ship."</p>

<p>"Where is the danger?"</p>

<p>"Suppose they were to mutiny?"</p>

<p>Farragut laughed, but there was a little uneasiness in
the laugh, for he had thought of the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>When he returned to the <i>Essex</i> that night he hesitated
whether to tell the captain of his fears or not, but he decided
that he would only be laughed at, so he held his
peace.</p>

<p>It so happened that Captain Vernon was to stay all night
on board the <i>Essex</i>, as the guest of Captain Porter, and
Farragut was glad, for he thought that even one extra
man on board would be of use in case of mutiny.</p>

<p>With these thoughts on his mind he threw himself in
his hammock and was soon asleep.</p>

<p>But he dreamed of mutiny.</p>

<p>His brain would not rest.</p>

<p>Several times he listened, but all was still, save for the
regular tramp of the men on duty.</p>

<p>Once a strange feeling of fear came over him.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes cautiously and saw the coxswain of
the captain's gig of the <i>Alert</i> standing over him, with a
pistol in one hand and a big knife in the other.</p>

<p>Farragut knew the man was a prisoner, and, seeing him
armed, was positive something was wrong.</p>

<p>"I shall be killed now," he thought, and closed his eyes
again, lying very still.</p>

<p>He dare not move.</p>

<p>Expecting to feel the knife pierce to his heart every
instant, he yet had sufficient control over himself to restrain
his desire to call out.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes slightly and saw the man move
away.</p>

<p>He was muttering to himself, and Farragut heard him
say:</p>

<p>"To-night! All are sleeping. Then for merry England."</p>

<p>Farragut slipped out of his hammock and crept cautiously
to the captain's cabin.</p>

<p>Porter had dined well, and had drunk pretty deeply
with his officers and guest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the custom in those days, and no one was considered
a gentleman unless he could drink his two or three
bottles of wine.</p>

<p>Farragut shook the captain.</p>

<p>"Hello! what is it?"</p>

<p>"Hush! on your life, hush!"</p>

<p>"What is it? David, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Hush, captain; don't speak aloud. The men of the
<i>Alert</i> have got to the armory, and to-night are to mutiny!"</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Never mind now; but act at once, or it may be too
late."</p>

<p>Captain Porter did not like being aroused out of his
sleep.</p>

<p>Who does?</p>

<p>But Porter was a man of action, and was awake in an
instant.</p>

<p>The captain was very strict about "fire drill," and was
accustomed, so that his men might be ready for any emergency,
to raise the cry of "Fire!" at all hours of the day
or night, and often he caused a slight smoke to be created
in the hold to try the nerves of his men.</p>

<p>At the cry of "Fire!" every man seized his cutlass and
blanket and went to quarters as though the ship were
about to go into action.</p>

<p>When he realized the import of Farragut's information,
he ran on the deck and shouted:</p>

<p>"Fire! fire!"</p>

<p>In an instant the crew were at their quarters in perfect
order, every man armed.</p>

<p>The mutineers thought that a bad time for their project,
and waited.</p>

<p>But the captain was not satisfied.</p>

<p>He paraded all the prisoners and ordered them searched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly every man had some weapon concealed on his
person.</p>

<p>When these were taken away, the prisoners were ordered
back to their quarters.</p>

<p>And early on the following morning they were put on
the <i>Alert</i>, and that vessel was sent to St. Johns as a cartel.</p>

<p>The <i>Essex</i> was saved by the vigilance of young Middie
Farragut, and the records at Washington bear proof to
the fact.</p>

<p>When off the Maine coast the <i>Lively Bee</i> bade adieu to
the <i>Essex</i>, and started for the Penobscot, where she could
be put in fighting trim again.</p>

<p>"I wish you were going with us, Tempest," said Farragut.</p>

<p>"So do I; but I cannot say I wish you were going with
us."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Essex</i> is a war ship, the <i>Lively Bee</i> but a privateer,"
answered Tempest, sadly; for he still thought there
was something of disgrace in being a privateer.</p>

<p>David Farragut, with a wisdom beyond his age, answered
his friend:</p>

<p>"If I were not on the <i>Essex</i>, I would prefer to be on a
privateer. Both are fighting for the same flag, and while
we are bound by strict discipline, you can go where you
like and fight when you please. Yours is a glorious life,
and I almost wish for it myself."</p>

<p>"Then you are not ashamed of me?"</p>

<p>"Ashamed? I am proud, and so will the country be
when this war is over. We shall meet again&mdash;of that I
am sure."</p>

<p>And so the two friends parted. They did meet again;
they met when civil war had rent the country in twain,
for John Tempest was with Admiral Farragut when New
Orleans was surrendered, and again was on his ship in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
1863, when in passing Port Hudson on the Mississippi,
held by the Confederates, Farragut's son, then a boy of
twelve, asked his father to let him go to West Point.</p>

<p>"He has your grit," said Tempest, and then turning to
the boy he added: "I served with your father when he
was younger than you are."</p>

<p>"Times have changed," said the admiral.</p>

<p>"In what way?" asked the son.</p>

<p>"You could not stand fire, my boy."</p>

<p>"Try me, father."</p>

<p>Then came that magnificent test of courage which ought
to be depicted on the walls of the Capitol by the greatest
artist of the day.</p>

<p>"Come up here with me, my boy," said the admiral.</p>

<p>Farragut and his son went up together into the maintop;
the old man had himself and boy lashed to it, and in
this way they passed Port Hudson.</p>

<p>The Confederates saw the daring act. Sharpshooters
took aim at the admiral; a heavy gun was trained on that
target, and the ball tore away some of the rigging, but
neither father nor son flinched.</p>

<p>"My boy, you have the right pluck, you shall go to
West Point," said the admiral when again he descended
to the deck, and old John Tempest, then seventy years of
age, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"God bless you, David! you are just like what your
father was when I knew him first."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A BRUSH WITH THE ENEMY.</p>


<p>When the <i>Lively Bee</i> parted company with the <i>Essex</i>,
Captain Vernon began to put her in fighting trim.</p>

<p>"Always be ready, is my maxim," he said to Tempest.</p>

<p>"But surely you do not expect&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To meet the enemy? I never expect anything else."</p>

<p>"But we are disabled."</p>

<p>"All the more reason why we may be attacked by the
enemy. Our disabled condition invites it."</p>

<p>So the preparations proceeded, and there was not a man
on the <i>Lively Bee</i> but hoped a chance of a fight would be
offered.</p>

<p>And their wish was gratified.</p>

<p>On the morning of the second day a frigate flying the
British flag hove in sight.</p>

<p>"She is too big for us to tackle," said Tempest.</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;" and Captain Vernon walked to and
fro for a few minutes without finishing his sentence.</p>

<p>Tempest knew him well now, and awaited his pleasure.</p>

<p>"But it is a question of take or be taken. We can't run
from that frigate, with our present rig, and I don't want
to be taken prisoner."</p>

<p>"Neither do I. But what can we do?"</p>

<p>"Prove that we have spunk."</p>

<p>"I am with you, sir&mdash;ay, to the death."</p>

<p>"Well spoken, Tempest. I'd rather have a man like
you on board than a whole regiment of other men."</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> was lying much closer to the wind than
the Britisher.</p>

<p>The frigate, when first seen, was about two miles off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and had the <i>Lively Bee</i> been in as good trim as when she
left New York, no vessel afloat could have overtaken her.</p>

<p>"I know her, captain."</p>

<p>"Do you? Well, who and what is she?" asked Vernon.</p>

<p>"The <i>Peacock</i>, a thirty-two gunner," answered Tempest.</p>

<p>"Then we have no chance but in flight."</p>

<p>"None whatever."</p>

<p>"And we cannot outsail her," continued Vernon perversely.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Yet we will not be taken&mdash;at least not alive."</p>

<p>There was a determination in the conduct of the privateersman
which endeared him to his crew.</p>

<p>Had he ordered each man to shoot himself, no one
would have hesitated.</p>

<p>They gave their captain the most explicit obedience.</p>

<p>The <i>Peacock</i> drew nearer and challenged the <i>Lively Bee</i>
to show its colors.</p>

<p>"You shall have them. Up with the flag of the free,
boys!"</p>

<p>And the Stars and Stripes was run up the halliards,
while a ringing cheer burst from the crew of the privateer.</p>

<p>The Union Jack of England was soon run up in answer,
and followed by a shot.</p>

<p>The cannon ball fell wide of the mark and a sarcastic
cheer was borne over the water to the <i>Peacock</i>.</p>

<p>A broadside was fired at the <i>Lively Bee</i>, but again only
an upheaval of the water was the result.</p>

<p>"Can you cripple her, Tempest?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"I think so, sir."</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> suddenly threw her bow up into the
wind, and after a short pause, fired her long gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain of the privateer watched, through his glass,
and saw the shot skim over the water and strike the <i>Peacock</i>
square in the hull, entering near the bow and raking
the deck diagonally.</p>

<p>The Britisher did not answer, but kept on, crowding
all sail, and hoping to overtake the <i>Lively Bee</i> and blow
her out of the water.</p>

<p>Once again the long gun was fired, but little damage
was done, and the British ship answered with a broadside.</p>

<p>"Captain, I can cripple her next time, I think."</p>

<p>"Do so, at all hazards."</p>

<p>The Britisher was nearing her prey.</p>

<p>The privateer could not hold her own under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The frigate sailed faster than the <i>Lively Bee</i>, but, not
keeping a course so close to the wind, was constantly obliged
to tack, in order to keep near enough to use her guns
on the smaller vessel.</p>

<p>Tempest walked up to Vernon and put out his hand.</p>

<p>The captain grasped it.</p>

<p>There was a meaning in that handshake.</p>

<p>Each knew that if the next shot did not strike the
<i>Peacock</i> there was but little chance for the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>Lieutenant John Tempest saw that the gun was loaded.</p>

<p>The little privateer luffed, and the long gun was fired.</p>

<p>The shot struck just where it was intended it should.</p>

<p>That shot brought down the foretopmast of the <i>Peacock</i>
with the immediate result of throwing her up into
the wind to repair damages.</p>

<p>"Now, clap on all sail, for it is our only chance," cried
Vernon, and the <i>Lively Bee</i> began to make better headway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>They could see the <i>Peacock</i> black with men, and saw
that the wreck of the foretopmast was cleared away in a
comparatively short space of time.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Vernon, "the chase has commenced.
Hurrah for the <i>Lively Bee</i>!"</p>

<p>The men cheered lustily, and feared not the British
frigate, for they had obtained a good start.</p>

<p>Suddenly the heavy boom of a gun startled the crew
of the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>On the starboard side loomed up a man-of-war, from
whose gaff there floated the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>The <i>Peacock</i> shivered from bow to stern as the shot
raked her deck, and she knew she was powerless, for her
guns would not reach as far.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>Captain Vernon looked through his glass at the newcomer,
and a loud, ringing cheer burst from the crew of
the <i>Lively Bee</i>, as he spelled out the word:</p>

<p>"<i>C-o-n-s-t-i-t-u-t-i-o-n.</i>"</p>

<p>"The <i>Peacock</i> will lose its tail," said Scarron.</p>

<p>"We shall see some fun," added Mr. Webster.</p>

<p>And the <i>Lively Bee</i> saluted the big war ship, and
awaited further developments.</p>

<p>The <i>Peacock</i>, finding itself too far away from the <i>Constitution</i>,
fired a broadside at the privateer, which had allowed
itself to get within range.</p>

<p>The shots tore up a portion of the deck, and a splinter
struck Vernon on the shoulder, ploughing a furrow
through his flesh.</p>

<p>Tempest applied the match to his long gun again, and
as the shot flew through the air, he prayed it might disable
the Britisher.</p>

<p>A cry of distress was plainly heard from the <i>Peacock</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and later it was known that the captain and four of his
men had been killed by that shot.</p>

<p>The senior officer turned the ship about, and instead of
being the pursuer was now the pursued.</p>

<p>The men on the <i>Constitution</i> cheered the little privateer,
and the salute was warmly responded to by our friends.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">PREPARING FOR ACTION.</p>


<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i>, privateer, had won the laurels of war,
though she had not shared in the prizes, and Captain Vernon
saw that the crew were getting somewhat dissatisfied.
He called all hands on deck.</p>

<p>"Men, under the shadow of the U. S. frigate <i>Constitution</i>
I offer you terms," he said.</p>

<p>All listened attentively, for all were in wonder as to
his meaning.</p>

<p>"You are all fighters, and I believe desire to see the
Stars and Stripes honored on the sea as well as on land.
Is not that so?"</p>

<p>"It is. I can speak for all hands, captain," said Mr.
Scarron.</p>

<p>"I knew it. I don't think there is one on board the
<i>Lively Bee</i> who would value his life above liberty, but all
are ready to die fighting for our flag."</p>

<p>"That is true as gospel, captain."</p>

<p>"The commander of the <i>Constitution</i> will take you all
on board, and you can have your fill of fighting the enemy.
You will be regular men then, with no risks other
than all who engage in war will share with you.</p>

<p>"You can join the United States navy, or can remain
on the <i>Lively Bee</i>. Which shall it be?"</p>

<p>"We will stick to you, captain."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, the <i>Lively Bee</i> is a good enough craft for us."</p>

<p>"I thought you would say so, and I am well pleased it
is so. But we must put into port and get rigged up. We
have done a lot of fighting, but it has all been for others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Now, I propose taking some prizes for ourselves. What
say you?"</p>

<p>There was no need to await a reply.</p>

<p>Every man on the <i>Lively Bee</i> was a privateer from
choice and inclination.</p>

<p>He loved fighting, but wanted prize money as well as
glory.</p>

<p>"I will then, in your name, decline the offer made by
Captain Hull of the <i>Constitution</i>, and will make all sail
to the nearest port."</p>

<p>Captain Vernon boarded the <i>Constitution</i>, and was well
received.</p>

<p>Captain Hull, after he had seen the <i>Peacock</i> disabled,
had consulted the captain of the privateer, and had
agreed that it was not worth the trouble to overtake the
<i>Peacock</i>, as she would not be worth much as a prize, and
as the British vessel made full sail when the <i>Constitution</i>
appeared, he deemed it advisable to let it go.</p>

<p>It was then that the captain made the offer to Vernon,
which he had submitted to his men.</p>

<p>"I see what it is, Vernon. Your answer is one declining
to join the navy. Well, mayhap you are right.
And we shall meet, it may be, again. I did hear that the
<i>Guerriere</i> was in these waters, and I am in search of her."</p>

<p>"She is a formidable war ship."</p>

<p>"I know, and a strange thing occurs to my mind. I
have a bet with the captain on the result of our first engagement."</p>

<p>"A wager?"</p>

<p>"Yes, over a year ago our two vessels were lying in the
Delaware. We exchanged calls. Captain Dacres of the
<i>Guerriere</i> is a rattling good fellow&mdash;for an Englishman.
'Well, Dacres,' I said I one day, 'you may just take care
of that ship of yours, if ever I catch her with the <i>Constitution</i>.'
Captain Dacres laughed good humoredly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
offered to bet me a sum of money that, in case of a conflict,
I should be the loser. 'No,' said I, 'I'll bet no money
on it; but I will stake you a hat that the <i>Constitution</i>
comes out victorious.' 'Done!' cried Dacres, and so the
bet was made."</p>

<p>"I wish you luck, captain," said Vernon, "and I wish
you may tow the <i>Guerriere</i> into Boston as a prize."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Vernon. And I need scarcely say I return
the complimentary wish."</p>

<p>"I have a favor to ask you," said Vernon.</p>

<p>"Name it, and it is granted."</p>

<p>"Don't be too positive. I shall be in port a couple of
weeks for repairs. I should like to send my first officer
with you for that time. Land him at any port you are
near. He shall have full directions how to find me."</p>

<p>"I should be delighted. What is his name?"</p>

<p>"John Tempest."</p>

<p>For a moment Captain Hull's face clouded, but a smile
soon suffused itself over his countenance.</p>

<p>"He was on the <i>Essex</i>," said Vernon.</p>

<p>"I know it; he resigned. I shall be pleased to have
him. He is a rattling good officer."</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that Lieutenant John Tempest
was to spend a week or two on the U. S. frigate <i>Constitution</i>.</p>

<p>Vernon had a deep motive in this.</p>

<p>He had taken a great liking to the young lieutenant,
and would like to have him reinstated in the navy.</p>

<p>Not that he wished to lose him, but he knew that
Tempest would be happier in the regular service than on
board a privateer.</p>

<p>Tempest was overjoyed.</p>

<p>Not that he wished to part from the <i>Lively Bee</i>, for he
had learned to love every board in her deck, and believed
no guns were better than hers; but he wanted once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to tread the deck of a large war ship, to see active service
conducted openly and honorably, and so he thanked Vernon
for his consideration and leave of absence.</p>

<p>The <i>Constitution</i> sailed away, and the <i>Lively Bee</i> entered
port.</p>

<p>It was not long after the naval vessel had parted from
the privateer, when the lookout aloft gave the long-drawn
out hail:</p>

<p>"Ship ho-o-o!"</p>

<p>"Whereaway?"</p>

<p>"Nor'-nor'east."</p>

<p>Instantly the course of the <i>Constitution</i> was shaped toward
the stranger.</p>

<p>In half an hour the glass was brought to bear upon
the distant vessel, and she was declared to be a frigate
and to be sailing toward the American.</p>

<p>Captain Hull began to make preparations for the meeting.</p>

<p>He acted with deliberation.</p>

<p>The <i>Constitution</i> was a valuable ship, and he dare not
expose her to unnecessary risks.</p>

<p>The topgallant sails were furled, and the lighter spars
lowered to the decks.</p>

<p>"The enemy is preparing also," said Tempest, who
stood looking through the glass.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," answered Captain Hull. "The
better prepared she is the greater our victory will be."</p>

<p>It was near five o'clock when the two war ships were
near enough to commence active work.</p>

<p>"The <i>Guerriere</i>!" shouted Tempest, as he read the
name of the Britisher.</p>

<p>Captain Hull almost forgot his dignity.</p>

<p>He wanted to dance, so delighted was he to meet that
vessel above all others.</p>

<p>"Beat to quarters!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Then followed a rush of barefooted men along the
deck.</p>

<p>There was no confusion; all ran in perfect order to
their stations.</p>

<p>As the roll of drums died away the midshipmen, in
boyish soprano, began calling off the quarter-bills, while
the men, in gruff and deep bass voices, responded.</p>

<p>Every man knew his place.</p>

<p>The cook, as well as the captain, knew just what was
expected of him.</p>

<p>The surgeon, with his assistants, descended to the cockpit
and got ready his instruments and bandages, his splints
and antiseptics.</p>

<p>The line of powder-passers was formed, the powder-monkeys
looking serious as they thought of the business
on hand.</p>

<p>While all these preparations were being made on the
<i>Constitution</i>, the crew of the <i>Guerriere</i> were not resting
quietly.</p>

<p>So many mean things have had to be recorded against
England in its struggles that it is pleasant to be able to
say a good word for Captain Dacres, of the British ship
<i>Guerriere</i>, thirty-eight guns.</p>

<p>He had on board a Marblehead sailor, Captain William
Orne, who had been captured some days before.</p>

<p>"Orne, tell me," said the captain of the man-of-war,
when the American was first sighted, "what think you
of yon ship?"</p>

<p>"An American frigate, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? It seems to me she is too bold."</p>

<p>"No, sir. No American can be anything else but bold
in this contest," replied Orne.</p>

<p>"I am glad you stick up for your country."</p>

<p>"I am right, sir; the vessel is armed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"So much the better. The better he behaves the greater
credit for us in taking him."</p>

<p>"Or <i>vice versa</i>, captain," Orne quietly added.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, I admire your patriotism, but England
is empress of the seas, and no vessel America can build
can make the <i>Guerriere</i> lower her flag. See, I will show
defiance!"</p>

<p>The captain ordered the English flag to be set at each
masthead, and the crew cheered lustily as the Union Jack
rose up the halliards.</p>

<p>The <i>Guerriere</i> backed her maintopsail and waited for
the American to commence the action.</p>

<p>"Captain Orne, as I suppose you will not wish to fight
against your countrymen, you are at liberty to retire below
the water line. And, stay&mdash;there are ten of my crew who
are American sailors who have been impressed; they can
go to the cockpit with you."</p>

<p>"I thank you for your generosity, Captain Dacres."</p>

<p>"Generosity&mdash;fiddle-de-dee, it is humanity. I should
not like to be made to fight against my own country."</p>

<p>In this way Captain Dacres won the respect of his enemies,
for he was both gallant and generous.</p>

<p>The order to beat to quarters was given, and the two
vessels were ready for a fierce fight.</p>

<p>Both captains were experienced officers, and both were
backed up by crews of undaunted valor.</p>

<p>The men were brave and equally patriotic.</p>

<p>The <i>Guerriere</i> was fighting for British supremacy, the
<i>Constitution</i> for American independence.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE FIGHT AT SEA</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah! then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could you have seen our men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How they sprung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their work of toil and clamor!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And their captains, with cord and hammer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept every muzzle ablaze."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Each ship was waiting for the other to make the first
move.</p>

<p>Both captains were cautious and anxious for victory.</p>

<p>After several movements, the <i>Guerriere</i> opened fire
with her weather broadside.</p>

<p>The shots fell short.</p>

<p>The British wore around, and let fly her port broadside.</p>

<p>Most of the shot tore through the American's rigging,
but two shots took effect in the hull.</p>

<p>The <i>Constitution</i> yawed a little, and fired three of her
bow guns.</p>

<p>Another broadside from the <i>Guerriere</i> answered the
shots.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tempest walked up and down the deck of
the <i>Constitution</i> uneasily.</p>

<p>Why such inaction?</p>

<p>He knew Hull to be capable, but his action was not
quick enough to suit the warm blood of the younger man.</p>

<p>Only occasionally was a shot fired from the American.</p>

<p>More care was exercised in dodging the fire from the
Britisher than in answering.</p>

<p>An hour had passed and only the American had been
injured, though but slightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Constitution</i> were becoming restive.</p>

<p>Captain Hull paced the quarterdeck with short, quick
steps.</p>

<p>Although outwardly calm, his whole body was burning
with checked excitement.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morris, the second in command, bit his lips
and moved his hands about nervously and uneasily.</p>

<p>"What does he mean?" he asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"That I have been wondering," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Shall I give them a broadside?" asked Morris, saluting
his chief.</p>

<p>"Not yet," was the reply.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morris paced the deck, almost angry at his
captain.</p>

<p>The <i>Guerriere</i> fired another broadside, and as the shots
tore away some of the rigging, the officer muttered to
himself:</p>

<p>"There will be mutiny if we don't take action."</p>

<p>Low as he spoke, Tempest heard him.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Did you hear? I am sorry I uttered my thoughts
aloud. I am afraid; the gunners are getting very impatient."</p>

<p>Tempest saw the captain pacing the deck, and the vessels
were getting so close together that it looked as if
the American intended to board the Britisher.</p>

<p>Again Morris asked if he should fire a broadside, and
again came the answer:</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>The <i>Guerriere</i> was only about half a pistol shot away.</p>

<p>Captain Hull had restrained his excitement as long as
he could.</p>

<p>He saw how close the enemy really was.</p>

<p>Then he was ready.</p>

<p>The moment for which he had waited had arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>He had drawn the Britisher into a trap by leading him
to believe the American would not fight.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, pour it into them!" he shouted with all the
lung power he possessed.</p>

<p>He stooped almost to the deck and threw his body up
again, cheering the men.</p>

<p>"Pour it into them!" he shouted again. "Hull her,
boys! Hull her!" And the crew, catching up the shout,
made the decks ring with the cry of "Hull her!" as they
loaded and let fly again.</p>

<p>Captain Hull gesticulated with such violence that the
tight breeches of his naval uniform split from hip to knee.</p>

<p>The effect of the broadside on the <i>Guerriere</i> was terrific.</p>

<p>The Britisher reeled and trembled as though in the
throes of a mighty earthquake.</p>

<p>With a tremendous crash the mizzen-mast was shot
away.</p>

<p>In a few moments Captain Dacres was told that the
cockpit was filled with wounded men.</p>

<p>The conflict was furious.</p>

<p>There was no more delay.</p>

<p>The firing was incessant.</p>

<p>Stripped to the waist, and covered with the stains of
powder and of blood, the gunners pulled fiercely at the
gun-tackle, and wielded the rammers with frantic energy.</p>

<p>Then the match was applied.</p>

<p>The death-dealing bolt crashed into the hull of the enemy
only a few yards distant.</p>

<p>The ships were broadside to broadside, when the mizzen-mast
of the English ship was shot away.</p>

<p>The force of the great spar falling upon the deck made
a great breach in the quarter of the ship.</p>

<p>The Americans cheered lustily when they saw the damage
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Constitution</i> poured in several effective broadsides,
and luffed slowly, until she lay right athwart the <i>Guerriere's</i>
bow.</p>

<p>The long bowsprit of the Englishman stretched far
across the <i>Constitution's</i> quarterdeck and was soon fouled
in the mizzen-rigging of the latter vessel.</p>

<p>The two ships swung helplessly around.</p>

<p>The bow of the Englishman lay snugly against the port-quarter
of the American.</p>

<p>"We could board her now," said Lieutenant Morris.</p>

<p>"I wish the captain would give the order," responded
Tempest, who was acting as second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"By Washington, but you shall see some fighting!" exclaimed
Captain Hull, as he saw that the Englishman was
preparing to board the <i>Constitution</i>.</p>

<p>The bugle blared from the quarterdeck of the <i>Guerriere</i>,
and the boarders sprang from their guns and seized
their heavy cutlasses and boarding-caps.</p>

<p>But Hull had ordered the boarding-bugle to sound, and
by the side of his vessel there appeared an equal number
of well-armed men.</p>

<p>Captain Dacres saw the kind of reception he would
meet with, and so ordered his men back to their guns.</p>

<p>The vessels were so close together that pistols were
freely used.</p>

<p>The topmen fired down at the deck of the opposing
ship and picked off many a brave man.</p>

<p>Captain Dacres was slightly wounded by a pistol shot
fired by John Tempest.</p>

<p>The thunder of the big guns could not down the cries
of pain and anger which arose from the throats of the
wounded men.</p>

<p>The air was filled with the ceaseless rattle of musketry,
the roar of cannon, the cracking of pistol shots, and the
cries of the injured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Often the protruding muzzles of the guns touched the
side of the opposing ship. And when the guns were run
in for loading the sailors would rush to the open ports
with muskets and pistols, and try to pick off some of the
enemy.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was an alarming cry, which rose above
all others and entirely overpowered them.</p>

<p>"Fire! Fire!"</p>

<p>Every one was horrified.</p>

<p>A sailor is more horrified at that cry than any other
which can be heard at sea.</p>

<p>He would rather be clinging to a mast in the open
ocean than stand on the deck of a stanch ship, if her
hold was on fire!</p>

<p>Flames were seen coming from the windows of the
cabin, which lay directly beneath the <i>Guerriere's</i> bow
guns.</p>

<p>While the shots were raking the decks, and every moment
the crew anticipated having to fight hand-to-hand,
man to man, not one felt any fear.</p>

<p>But when that cry of fire was raised, and the flames
seen, there was not a sailor or marine but trembled.</p>

<p>The flash of the enemy's guns had caused the fire, so
close were the vessels together.</p>

<p>Captain Hull did not lose his presence of mind.</p>

<p>With splendid discipline he soon had the flames extinguished
and the danger from fire averted.</p>

<p>Tempest had gone to the gun deck.</p>

<p>He pointed to the <i>Guerriere</i> and said:</p>

<p>"It was the flash from that gun which fired our cabin.
I will silence it."</p>

<p>He ordered a gun loaded, and sighted it himself.</p>

<p>The puff of smoke, followed by the roar of the cannon,
told of the passage of the shot, but it was not until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
smoke had cleared away that it was seen that Tempest's
shot had disabled the enemy's gun.</p>

<p>But while the men were extinguishing the flames the
brave Lieutenant Morris was attempting, with his own
hands, to lash the two ships together.</p>

<p>He saw that he should fail, and leaping upon the taffrail
called on his men to follow him.</p>

<p>Instantly Lieutenant Bush of the marines and Mr. Alwyn
were by his side, when a volley from the British
caused all three to fall back.</p>

<p>Bush was killed instantly and the other two were badly
wounded.</p>

<p>The ships drifted asunder.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tempest went to the long gun and with a
hurried request for permission to fire it, sighted with
deliberation.</p>

<p>A ringing cheer told of the result.</p>

<p>The <i>Guerriere's</i> foremast had been shot away and
had dragged down the mainmast with it in its fall.</p>

<p>The proud, trim-built and rigged Britisher was now a
shapeless hulk, tossing on the waters without chance to
retrieve its fallen fortunes.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">ON THE VERGE OF SUCCESS.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"'Why, here's a blow,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Dacres, as he hauled his flag below."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Although the <i>Guerriere</i> was a hopeless wreck, her captain,
with true bulldog courage, kept the British ensign
floating from the stump of her fallen mizzen-mast.</p>

<p>The blow must have been severe to the gallant English
officer, for he had fully believed the <i>Guerriere</i> to be invulnerable.</p>

<p>The <i>Constitution</i> drew away, but kept firing continuously,
and soon secured a raking position.</p>

<p>Dacres' eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"It is no use," he exclaimed to his first officer. "Haul
down the flag."</p>

<p>"Must we surrender?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"If I had only myself to consult I should say no. I
would rather sink with the <i>Guerriere</i> than live dishonored."</p>

<p>"There is no dishonor in our defeat, captain; but we
are all ready to fight until not a man lives."</p>

<p>"I know it; but that would be murder on my part.
Haul down the flag."</p>

<p>The captain went below.</p>

<p>He could not see the flag for which he had fought so
bravely lowered in defeat.</p>

<p>"Captain Orne, your compatriots have humbled me to-day,"
he said when he saw the American prisoner. "You
are free."</p>

<p>Orne could not express the jubilation he felt, for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
was something pitiful in the anguish shown by the brave
English captain.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Read was dispatched by Captain Hull to
board the prize.</p>

<p>He saw Orne, whom he recognized, and clasped his
hand in silence.</p>

<p>Captain Dacres staggered to the deck.</p>

<p>"Captain Hull presents his compliments," said the
American lieutenant, "and wishes to know if you have
struck your flag."</p>

<p>Captain Dacres looked at the ship, its decks strewn
with dead, and slippery with human blood, its shattered
masts, and he answered dryly:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I don't know what to say. Our mizzen-mast
is gone; our mainmast is gone; and I think, on the
whole, you had better report that we have struck our
flag."</p>

<p>Read saluted the captain, and stepped to the side of
the ship, but turned back.</p>

<p>"Would you like the assistance of a surgeon, or surgeon's
mate, in caring for your wounded?" he asked the
captain.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I should suppose you had on your own ship
business enough for all your medical officers."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," responded the American. "We have only
seven wounded, and their wounds have been dressed
some time ago."</p>

<p>Captain Dacres dare not attempt to answer, for had he
done so his voice would have been choked with sobs.</p>

<p>"Only seven wounded," he murmured, and remembered
that on the deck he had twenty-three dead or mortally
wounded, while his surgeons were busy attending to fifty-six
who were desperately injured.</p>

<p>Captain Orne returned with Lieutenant Read to the
<i>Constitution</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>He reported to Captain Hull, and was asked to describe
the state of the <i>Guerriere</i>.</p>

<p>"I came on deck about half-past seven," he said, "and
beheld a scene it would be impossible ever to forget.</p>

<p>"All the ship's masts were gone, and as she had no
sails to steady her, she was rolling like a log in the
trough of the sea."</p>

<p>"Were many killed and wounded?" asked Captain Hull.</p>

<p>"The crew were busy throwing the dead overboard,"
answered Orne; "the decks were covered with blood, and
looked more like a ship's slaughter house. The cockpit
is filled with wounded men."</p>

<p>It was hard to feel pleasure at such a report, and yet
the patriotism of Hull could scarcely repress a cheer.
But he asked Orne one other question:</p>

<p>"How are the survivors acting?"</p>

<p>"Badly&mdash;utterly demoralized. Some of the petty officers
got at the liquor and gave it out to the men. Many
are drunk, and what with their ribald songs, the noise
and confusion, the groans of the dying, it is like a perfect
hell, sir."</p>

<p>"Were such a thing as defeat to happen to the <i>Constitution</i>,"
said Hull, "I would with my own hand shoot the
first man who touched liquor."</p>

<p>The captain walked the deck uneasily for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Tempest!" he called, and there being no answer, he
turned to one of his boys. "Tell Mr. Tempest I want to
speak with him."</p>

<p>In a few moments the young officer of the <i>Lively Bee</i>
appeared.</p>

<p>"I want you to undertake a most difficult duty."</p>

<p>"I am prepared, sir."</p>

<p>"I knew it. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Quite, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want you to board the <i>Guerriere</i>&mdash;she is sinking
fast&mdash;and transfer all her officers and crew to our ship."</p>

<p>"Yes, captain; it shall be done."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;the men have got to the grog, you may have
difficulty. You have authority to shoot any one who disregards
your orders."</p>

<p>"The wounded shall be removed first."</p>

<p>"That is right. But stay; the officers must have precedence,
even over the wounded."</p>

<p>When Tempest left the captain's cabin, Orne remarked,
<i>sotto voce</i>:</p>

<p>"That young man will never return alive."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but I want to try his mettle."</p>

<p>"He is brave."</p>

<p>"Ay, as brave as any man who ever trod a deck."</p>

<p>In the first boatload Tempest sent from the British ship
was Captain Dacres.</p>

<p>As the defeated captain entered the victor's cabin he
unclasped his sword from his hip and handed it silently
to Captain Hull.</p>

<p>The American put it gently back.</p>

<p>"No, no, captain; I'll not take a sword from one who
knows so well how to use it. But I will trouble you
for that hat."</p>

<p>Captain Dacres looked perplexed.</p>

<p>Hull laughed, as he added:</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten our bet made a year ago on the
Delaware?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I now recall it. That hat is yours; but it
seems to me you want a new pair of breeches more than
a hat," and the Englishman pointed to the torn breeches
worn by Hull.</p>

<p>"Ah, you have noticed my personal casualty; but,
Dacres, it was my own doing. Don't write to England
and say you inflicted the damage."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Tempest, as was expected, had a hard time with the
prisoners, who had taken more grog than allowed by the
rules of the service.</p>

<p>One of the petty officers staggered up to the young
officer.</p>

<p>"By Jove, younker, I'll have you thrown overboard,"
he said.</p>

<p>A lot of drunken gunners, naked to the waist and armed
with cutlasses, cheered him and crowded around Tempest
to carry out the threat.</p>

<p>The young man never moved!</p>

<p>He raised his pistol and leveling it at the head of the
officer said:</p>

<p>"Give me your sword."</p>

<p>The man meekly obeyed.</p>

<p>With a sword in one hand, a pistol in the other, he faced
the drunken gunners.</p>

<p>"The first man who attempts to touch me, dies. Lay
down your weapons on the deck."</p>

<p>"By St. George, hark to the child!" said one of the
men. "Are you afraid? See, I'll take his plaything
from him."</p>

<p>The man stepped forward, but Tempest was too quick
for him, and a well-aimed thrust with the sword placed
the man <i>hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>"Lay down your weapons," he shouted, as he drew his
sword from the dead man's body.</p>

<p>The men obeyed sullenly.</p>

<p>They had met their master, and knew it.</p>

<p>Tempest knew that the prisoners were not to be trusted
while any of them were armed.</p>

<p>He, however, did not show his distrust, but walked
about, giving orders for the removal of all on board the
<i>Guerriere</i>, together with their effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>A drunken officer, a mere petty official, crept up behind
the young privateer, pistol in hand.</p>

<p>Tempest suddenly turned, and with a sweep of his
sword cut the pistol from the man's hand.</p>

<p>But he had struck deeper than he knew at that moment,
for with the pistol went the fellow's hand as well.</p>

<p>The sword cut had severed his wrist.</p>

<p>There was no more opposition, and the last man was
in the boat.</p>

<p>Only Tempest remained on board the once proud war
vessel.</p>

<p>He searched every deck, he descended to the cockpit,
and when satisfied that not a living creature remained on
board he fired the ship in a dozen places.</p>

<p>Then he returned to the deck, to see that the boat was
several fathoms away.</p>

<p>He called, but there was no response; evidently he had
not been heard.</p>

<p>He signaled for help.</p>

<p>In a few moments the flames would reach the magazine.</p>

<p>Once more he called, but his voice was drowned in the
noise of the crackling of the timbers and the roar of the
flames.</p>

<p>He had secured an English flag and waved it, hoping to
attract attention.</p>

<p>Just on the verge of success he seemed doomed to a
terrible death.</p>

<p>He saw the boat stop. Had the crew seen him?</p>

<p>He shouted.</p>

<p>He waved the flag, but again he saw the oars dip the
water, and he gave up all hope. With a cry of despair
he flung himself into the water, and at the same moment
a terrific explosion told him that the fire had reached the
magazine, and that the <i>Guerriere</i> was destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Showers of timber and ropes, pieces of sails and ship's
stores fell around him, and a dead body was hurled with
frantic force against him, sickening him even more than
the terrible strain and exhaustion.</p>

<p>With a cry to Heaven for help, he buffeted the waves
in one last despairing effort.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE RETURN OF THE CONQUEROR.</p>


<p>"Where is that brave man who, at the risk of his life,
rescued our wounded and our men?" asked Captain
Dacres, as he paced the deck of the <i>Constitution</i> with
Captain Hull.</p>

<p>"Is he not in the boat?" asked Hull.</p>

<p>"I see him not. I should feel that a great calamity had
happened were he not to return," responded the British
officer.</p>

<p>Captain Hull took the glass and looked at the approaching
boat.</p>

<p>He knew Tempest so well that he was sure he would
be the last to leave the sinking ship.</p>

<p>Tempest was not in the boat.</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Tempest with you?"</p>

<p>The answer came back clear and distinct.</p>

<p>"No, sir; he fell overboard and we could not find him."</p>

<p>Captain Dacres seemed more affected than did the
American commander.</p>

<p>"If you will order a boat lowered I will go with a crew
to find him," he said, and there was a deep earnestness
in his voice.</p>

<p>"Lower a boat!" ordered Captain Hull.</p>

<p>The davits were swung around and the boat lowered.</p>

<p>Dacres pleaded so earnestly that he was permitted to go
with the small crew in search of the missing man.</p>

<p>It was a generous act, and the name of Dacres was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
as much honored in Faneuil Hall, a few days later, as that
of Cornwallis was execrated.</p>

<p>The little boat skimmed over the waves toward the
wreck, portions of which were still burning.</p>

<p>The hull of the <i>Guerriere</i> was floating about, a mass
of flame, for, although a wreck, the stout vessel seemed
too proud to give in.</p>

<p>Another explosion lifted the little boat out of the water,
and sent its crew into the waves.</p>

<p>They speedily righted it and climbed in.</p>

<p>"See! there he is," cried Midshipman Eagle, pointing
to a human head which was just discernible on the water.</p>

<p>"Pull for your lives, men!" shouted Dacres, and the
men obeyed with a hearty good will.</p>

<p>"Steady there! Look to the starboard side, right!
Now, then, boys, for a strong pull."</p>

<p>The little boat shot forward, and Dacres stretched forth
his hand toward the floating object.</p>

<p>He caught Tempest's shoulder and held it in an iron
grip until young Eagle saw him, and then he, too, reached
over and helped to pull the young privateer into the boat.</p>

<p>Tempest had lost consciousness, but, as Dacres said,
"while there is life there is hope."</p>

<p>"Pull hard, you lazy fellows," shouted the English captain.
"A few minutes' delay, and one of the bravest men
I have known will be dead."</p>

<p>The men bent their backs, and the oars dipped the
water. Never had boat sped along so fast.</p>

<p>Eagle was rubbing Tempest's stomach and chest as he
lay in the boat.</p>

<p>A loud cheer greeted the little crew as the boat was
made fast alongside the <i>Constitution</i>, and when Lieutenant
John Tempest of the <i>Lively Bee</i>, privateer, was
lifted on deck, another cheer rent the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Middie Eagle reported to the captain, and his praise
of Dacres was just and generous.</p>

<p>"Dang me, captain!" he exclaimed in an off-hand manner,
almost forgetting that he was addressing his superior
officer, "dang me, but the English captain ordered
the men about as though they were English, and the boys
obeyed. Only think, a few hours ago we were trying to
blow Dacres into kingdom come, and now we are obeying
his commands."</p>

<p>Captain Hull grasped the Englishman's hand with a
vigorous grip.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Captain Dacres. If all Englishmen were
like you, there would be no need of war, and you would
help us sing 'Yankee Doodle,' while we would join in
singing 'God Save the King.'"</p>

<p>"That is how it ought to be, Captain Hull, and God
grant it may come soon. We are one people, even if we
do run on different routes."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, there is room for us both, and some day we
shall join hands as brothers."</p>

<p>While the two captains were talking, the men on deck
were rolling Tempest over a barrel to eject the water.</p>

<p>The young man was strong and healthy, and was not
fated to be drowned that time.</p>

<p>A good stiff glass of grog seemed to revive him wonderfully,
and after a sleep he awoke just as the good
ship <i>Constitution</i>, all decked out with bunting, was entering
Boston harbor.</p>

<p>The bells of King's Chapel and the Old South Church
were ringing out merrily, and crowds were gathered on
the wharves.</p>

<p>For the display of bunting on the war ship betokened
victory.</p>

<p>The city gave itself up to a joyousness almost unprecedented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no time for much preparation, for the <i>Constitution</i>
had been sighted only just outside the harbor,
but the city did what it could.</p>

<p>A signal was fired for the war ship to anchor until a
boat could put off for the news.</p>

<p>At first Captain Hull was inclined to disregard it.</p>

<p>When war had been declared against England, the flags
were all hoisted in the city, but at half mast; funeral
dirges were played through the streets, and a meeting
was held in Faneuil Hall to express mourning and humiliation.</p>

<p>Hull remembered this, and chafed at the thought that
Boston was the nearest port.</p>

<p>But he remembered his country, and if Boston wanted
to rejoice with the victors, it might be of advantage
nationally.</p>

<p>So he ordered the salute to be answered, and he anchored
until the boat could reach him.</p>

<p>The worthy mayor of the city came off in the boat,
wearing all the trappings of his office.</p>

<p>He clambered on deck with the usual awkwardness of a
landsman, and bowed very low as he saluted Captain
Hull.</p>

<p>The naval officer was blunt and honest.</p>

<p>He spoke to the point, and never weighed his words
long.</p>

<p>He hated obsequiousness, and hesitated whether to deal
with the mayor courteously or brusquely.</p>

<p>But his sense of good manners conquered, and he
greeted the citizen with the greatest courtesy.</p>

<p>"How long wilt thou wait outside the harbor?" asked
the mayor.</p>

<p>"One hour. The tide forbids me further delay," was
the answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>The mayor descended to the boat, and was rowed back
to the city.</p>

<p>Every few minutes he forgot his dignity and shouted
to fishermen, lightermen and crafts of all kinds:</p>

<p>"Get out your flags, England has been beaten."</p>

<p>It was surprising how soon the ships in the harbor were
decked with bunting.</p>

<p>Every flag was flying, and all sorts of things pressed
into service.</p>

<p>One man tore up his red shirt to make a pennon;
women gave up red and blue shawls; children contributed
clothing; anything of bright color was utilized, and the
scene was almost instantly transformed from the somberness
of everyday life to the brilliancy of festival attire.</p>

<p>A great flotilla of gayly decorated boats went out to
meet and surround the <i>Constitution</i>.</p>

<p>The flags of surrounding vessels were dipped in salutation
as the war-scarred veteran ship made her way to the
wharf.</p>

<p>The Boston Artillery Company, that organization whose
deeds will never be forgotten, assembled on the dock and
fired a national salute.</p>

<p>As the guns of the <i>Constitution</i> responded, Captain
Hull remarked that he fired them with more pleasure than
when another vessel was the target.</p>

<p>The people needed cheering, for all the news had been
of disaster.</p>

<p>The British had gained victories on land.</p>

<p>The Canadian frontier, near Detroit, had been the scene
of American reverses, and the people were beginning to
despair.</p>

<p>The victory gained by Captain Hull raised the people
into an elysium of excitement.</p>

<p>England had been empress of the seas, but on her own
domain she had been beaten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>It was no use for any English apologist to declare the
<i>Guerriere</i> to be an inferior ship, for she had been lauded
to the skies, and her invulnerability praised by poet and
statesman.</p>

<p>When the British squadron left the English coast, the
London <i>Naval Chronicle</i> took for its motto the distich:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The winds and seas are Britain's domain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not a sail but by permission spreads."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the <i>Guerriere</i> was praised in the most fulsome language.</p>

<p>The people of Boston were almost frantic with joy.</p>

<p>When Captain Hull landed he found the city decked
with bunting, and the streets crowded with people.</p>

<p>In front of Faneuil Hall was a large white banner, on
which the words had been hastily painted:</p>

<p>"The <i>Constitution</i>, a bunch of pine boards under a bit
of striped bunting."</p>

<p>The paint was not dry; how could it be?</p>

<p>It ran over the white canvas; but, blurred as it was, it
did its work.</p>

<p>With all the enthusiasm, Captain Hull was still the calm
naval officer, not spoiled by praise or injured by flattery.</p>

<p>The mayor had given orders for a grand banquet to be
prepared to be given the officers of the ship.</p>

<p>Six hundred sat down, and the first toast, after that of
the President, was to the "Bunch of pine boards under a
bit of striped bunting."</p>

<p>At the banquet, trying to escape unnoticed, was Captain
Harry Vernon, of the <i>Lively Bee</i>, privateer.</p>

<p>He wondered whether the people would hail him with
the same joy as they did Captain Hull, were he to return
a victor.</p>

<p>But one saw him, and hastened to his side.</p>

<p>"Captain, how is the <i>Lively Bee</i>?" asked John Tempest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>"She sails to-morrow, Tempest."</p>

<p>"Is my place still vacant, for I want to sign."</p>

<p>"Your place should be in the regular navy."</p>

<p>"My place, captain, is with the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>There was no moving Tempest when he had made up
his mind, and, to tell the truth, Vernon was right glad to
have him back.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE LIVELY BEE'S PLUCK.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Now coil up y'r nonsense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Bout England's great navy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take in y'r slack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About oak-hearted tars.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Sang the crew of the <i>Lively Bee</i> as they worked hard
getting ready to proceed to sea.</p>

<p>Mr. Scarron, who led the song, stopped suddenly, and
with a Yankee exclamation, more forcible than polite, declared
that he hoped he might go to Davy Jones' locker
if his eyes didn't see "Lieutenant Tempest a-coming
aboard the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>"Shiver my timbers, but you are right, sir," answered
Mr. Watson, "and it is a right good day for the <i>Lively
Bee</i>."</p>

<p>It was true.</p>

<p>In the captain's boat, seated by the side of Vernon, was
John Tempest, who had declined the offers made by Captain
Hull, and had thrown in his fate with that of the
privateer.</p>

<p>A hearty ringing cheer from the crew welcomed the
young man on board, and Scarron led off with the chorus,
which was then so popular in the navy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"'Charge the can cheerily,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Send it round merrily;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's to our country and captains commanding.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Thank you, boys! I am glad to be with you again,"
responded Tempest.</p>

<p>"But you've seen some good fighting, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Scarron, and nearly got drowned," answered
the young officer.</p>

<p>"So I heard, sir, so I heard! That was a brave Englishman,
that same captain."</p>

<p>"Brave, yes; but do you know, Scarron, he is now
saying that the <i>Guerriere</i> was not in fighting trim."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! That is a good 'un. Why, when Rodgers'
fleet was outside New York, didn't that same Dacres
send word that the <i>Guerriere</i> could fight and sink the
whole of Uncle Sam's navy?"</p>

<p>"So he did, Scarron, so he did. But the <i>Guerriere</i> is at
the bottom of the sea now."</p>

<p>"Now, boys!" shouted the captain, "bid good-by to your
sweethearts, for we're off to the Indies, and shall not return
until we can tow some prizes into port, and then
won't we make the dollars jingle? Let us have a rousing
good chorus, Mr. Scarron, before we settle down to duty."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"'Charge the can cheerily,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Send it round merrily;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's to our country and captains commanding.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again and again did the crew of the <i>Lively Bee</i> repeat
the chorus, and as they sang the anchor was weighed, the
sails all set, and the privateer was skimming the water
as proud and trim as ever.</p>

<p>"She is a taut little craft," said Vernon exultingly as
he looked from deck to rigging.</p>

<p>"Indeed she is, captain, and she deserves to be successful."</p>

<p>"As she must be."</p>

<p>"Whither are you bound?" asked Tempest after a long
pause.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of the Indies. What say you?"</p>

<p>"I think you are right. If we want prizes we must get
away from the fleet. Any prize taken will be so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
glory for the navy, so we must work alone. Now, if we
can get to Jamaica, we shall be sure to find some rich
prizes."</p>

<p>"Yes, all the way from a seventy-four to a big merchantman
with coffee and sugar, worth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anywhere between thirty and a hundred thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"The risk is great."</p>

<p>"That is just what we like."</p>

<p>The two men were well agreed, and Tempest knew
that the captain of the privateer was as stanch as ever.</p>

<p>For many days the <i>Lively Bee</i> sailed over the waters
without meeting with any hostile ship, and only taking a
few small prizes.</p>

<p>One morning Lieutenant Tempest called out suddenly:</p>

<p>"All hands! make sail!"</p>

<p>Vernon was in his cabin, but heard the order and
thought his watchful lieutenant saw a storm brewing.
He hurried on deck and saw three war vessels in the distance,
with their bows pointed in the direction of the
<i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"British, sir, without a doubt."</p>

<p>"Then we must run."</p>

<p>"I am afraid so, sir; we could not fight three frigates
at once."</p>

<p>"No, no. Well, we are safe."</p>

<p>And he spoke rightly.</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> was in no danger. With her fine lines
and great speed of canvas, she could take advantage of
every change of the wind, and pursue it to the uttermost.</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> would fly with a puff of wind, while the
big ships would scarcely move.</p>

<p>Before noon the sharp eyes of the first officer had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
out the <i>Frolic</i> and the <i>Poietiers</i>, both heavily manned
frigates.</p>

<p>"It is no good tackling them," said the captain.</p>

<p>"No, but they may attack us."</p>

<p>"We will keep out of range."</p>

<p>"They are getting ready to lower the boats, and will
board us."</p>

<p>"That is what I was afraid of," answered Captain Vernon.</p>

<p>"Get out the sweeps, boys, and pull with all your
might."</p>

<p>Slowly, but with a quicker motion than was possible for
the war ships, the <i>Lively Bee</i> got out of the range of the
<i>Frolic</i> and <i>Poietiers</i>.</p>

<p>But there was the third Britisher, a brig, which Tempest
had not taken much notice of.</p>

<p>Suddenly the young officer shouted to the captain:</p>

<p>"A merchantman!"</p>

<p>"Where away?"</p>

<p>"Being convoyed by the war ships."</p>

<p>It was true. The third vessel was a rich merchantman,
which had been traveling under the protection of
the men-of-war.</p>

<p>By some miscalculation she had drifted away from her
escort, and was practically defenseless.</p>

<p>"If we can't take her we can make her valueless," said
Tempest.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Let me try."</p>

<p>"The <i>Lively Bee</i> is at your service."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tempest stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Clear away the long gun. We'll fire one shot, anyway."</p>

<p>The men were delighted, although it looked like a piece
of impudence and folly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Load carefully. I will sight the gun myself," said
Tempest.</p>

<p>The men in the sweeps watched the action and awaited
commands.</p>

<p>"Avast pulling!"</p>

<p>The oars rested. The <i>Lively Bee</i> drifted over the
smooth water.</p>

<p>Tempest took very deliberate sights. Then, when satisfied,
he stepped back from the breech.</p>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>The shot went skimming through the air, and struck
the merchantman in the waist.</p>

<p>The British warships heard the report, and seemed
astounded at the sauciness of the little <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>Such impudence could not be allowed to go unpunished.</p>

<p>But Tempest had no intention of being caught just
then.</p>

<p>"Give way, boys, in those sweeps! Make all you can."</p>

<p>The crew did pull with all their might, and the <i>Lively
Bee</i> seemed to fly over the water.</p>

<p>The <i>Frolic</i> fired a broadside at the privateer, but all the
ammunition was wasted, as the <i>Lively Bee</i> was out of
range.</p>

<p>Another shot was fired at the merchantman, and her
mainmast went over with an awful crash.</p>

<p>"Now we must run for it, but it does seem a pity," said
Captain Vernon.</p>

<p>"Do not be in too great a hurry."</p>

<p>The long gun was loaded again, and a third shot went
raking the deck of the unfortunate vessel.</p>

<p>"Look out; we are in for squalls now!" shouted Vernon.</p>

<p>And almost within a pistol shot was the <i>Frolic's</i> long
boat, with a crew of boarders.</p>

<p>"Beat to quarters!" shouted Vernon.</p>

<p>He was only just in time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>The daring Britishers clambered up the chains, they
swung themselves into the rigging, and gained the deck
of the <i>Lively Bee</i> with astonishing alertness.</p>

<p>Headed by their officers, the crew of the privateer
clutched their cutlasses with firm grip, and met the invaders.</p>

<p>It was a terrible fight.</p>

<p>Confined within the small space of the deck of the
schooner, four dozen men were cutting and slashing at
each other with savage fury.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Smith of the <i>Frolic</i> was wounded dangerously
almost the minute he landed.</p>

<p>The deck was covered with blood.</p>

<p>So many men were killed that their bodies became a
menace and a danger to the living, who fell over them
and endangered their lives.</p>

<p>Tempest had struck terrifically at one of the British,
but missed because the man stepped back, and the privateer's
way was blocked by a dead body.</p>

<p>With wonderful celerity Tempest picked up the corpse
and threw it overboard.</p>

<p>His example was instantly followed, and every dead
body was given to the waves, and alas! some of the
wounded met the same watery grave.</p>

<p>The fight did not last long.</p>

<p>The British were beaten so thoroughly that the few
survivors begged for mercy.</p>

<p>It was only after the fight that Vernon discovered that
the two men-of-war had escaped.</p>

<p>The merchantman drifted about helplessly, and was
soon boarded by the crew of the privateer.</p>

<p>She proved to be a rich prize, and her captain could not
help admiring the courage of the privateer who had taken
his vessel away from two of the most noted war ships of
the British navy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not cowardice which caused the two vessels to
escape.</p>

<p>Just on the verge of the horizon they saw some American
men-of-war, and they determined to give chase, leaving
the merchantman a prize in the hands of the privateer.</p>

<p>The boarding crew had been deserted only when it was
found that they stood no chance of capturing the <i>Lively
Bee</i>.</p>

<p>Although the captain of the merchantman admired the
privateer's courage, he was none the less grieved over the
loss of his vessel and her rich cargo.</p>

<p>Five of the English boarders had been taken prisoners,
and to these he went.</p>

<p>He made them liberal offers if they would but break
loose and aid him in retaking his ship.</p>

<p>They were not averse to the project, if they saw the
slightest chance of success.</p>

<p>Circumstances favored them.</p>

<p>Captain Vernon sent the prisoners on board the merchant
prize, and placed Tempest in command.</p>

<p>The prisoner-captain was permitted his freedom on
parole.</p>

<p>He gave his sacred word that he would not try to escape,
and yet his heart was full of treachery, his brain
occupied in hatching schemes of mutiny.</p>

<p>That night a heavy fog sprang up, and the two vessels
dare not stay too close together.</p>

<p>That was the opportunity.</p>

<p>With cat-like tread the captain descended to the cabin,
where the English sailors were imprisoned.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tempest had grave suspicions about the
man's honesty, and set himself to watch him.</p>

<p>From a point of vantage he heard every word, and
formed his plans.</p>

<p>The prisoners were not placed in irons, and so only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
slight barrier of a door stood between them and the freedom
of the deck.</p>

<p>The night was dark and the fog more dense.</p>

<p>It was at three bells, or half-past one in the morning,
that the attempt was to be made.</p>

<p>Tempest arranged his plans, and to all appearance
everything went on as usual.</p>

<p>A few minutes before the striking of three bells, three
of the crew of the <i>Lively Bee</i> might have been seen creeping
cautiously to the top of the companionway.</p>

<p>Had any one been there to watch most minutely, he
would have seen that each of the three was armed with
pistol and marlin-spike.</p>

<p>The bells struck, and a man felt his way cautiously up
the companionway.</p>

<p>He had only just slipped on the deck when a terrific
blow from a marlin spike held by Tempest felled him to
the deck.</p>

<p>Another man crept up just as quietly to meet the same
fate, while a third, thinking something was wrong, saved
his life by hesitating.</p>

<p>Tempest turned a flash from his lantern down the steps
and saw the merchant captain handing a pistol to the
hesitating sailor.</p>

<p>A quick shot pierced the traitor's heart, and the sailor
fell on his knees and begged for mercy.</p>

<p>Thus ended the attempt to recapture the prize.</p>

<p>In the morning the <i>Lively Bee</i> towed the merchant prize
into port and placed her in the hands of a reliable agent
for sale.</p>

<p>Captain Jacob Jones was one of the proudest men in
the American navy; his pride had good foundation, for
he had served in the war with Tripoli and had been a
captive among the barbarians of Northern Africa.</p>

<p>When he left the Delaware in command of the U. S.
ship <i>Wasp</i>, to fight the British, he determined that his
vessel should be as great a torment to the enemy as the
insect after which she was named was to people on shore.</p>

<p>After a few days' cruising he fell in with the <i>Lively
Bee</i>, and learned that the <i>Frolic</i> and <i>Poietiers</i> were cruising
about in the waters nearby.</p>

<p>Not long after a bunch of sails was sighted at some
distance.</p>

<p>The most careful examination failed to reveal the character
of the strangers.</p>

<p>Jones was filled with curiosity.</p>

<p>He drew nearer the strange ships and reconnoitered.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing great guns, and a heavy sea
was running.</p>

<p>Only the day before, the <i>Wasp</i> had lost her jibboom,
with two sailors who were upon it.</p>

<p>The American seemed thoroughly at home in a storm.</p>

<p>His whole soul was in his work, and he cared not for
wind or hurricane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>As he drew near, he saw that the strangers were merchantmen,
under the protection of an English man-of-war.</p>

<p>The merchantmen were well armed, some carrying as
many as twelve guns.</p>

<p>Jones knew it would be suicidal folly to attack all at
once, so he kept on a course parallel with the Englishman
all that day and through the night.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the Britisher saw the American,
and showed his teeth.</p>

<p>The Jackies were at work on both vessels, repairing the
damages caused by the storm.</p>

<p>The <i>Wasp</i> ran up the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>It was a defiance.</p>

<p>But the Englishman answered by running a Spanish
flag up the halliards.</p>

<p>Jones was not deceived, for he knew the frigate to be
the <i>Frolic</i>, and the foe was worthy of his steel.</p>

<p>The ships drew near each other.</p>

<p>The sea was rough, the wind high, and both captains
were confident that before an hour had passed one ship
would have to strike its flag.</p>

<p>When less than sixty yards away, and both running on
the starboard tack, the action commenced.</p>

<p>Broadsides were exchanged, the <i>Frolic</i> firing three to
the <i>Wasp's</i> two.</p>

<p>Great clouds of spray washed over the bows; waves,
each one seeming higher than the last, swept over the
forecastle, drenching the sailors as they stood at their
quarters.</p>

<p>As the broadsides thundered forth the sailors cheered
as they saw the damage done by the fire.</p>

<p>The vessels were tossed about like corks, now wallowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
in the trough of the sea, now and again tossed high
on the crest of some gigantic wave.</p>

<p>It seemed marvelous that any damage could be done
by the broadsides, for at one moment the guns would be
pointed at the clouds, and the next submerged beneath the
billowy waves.</p>

<p>The two boats were well matched, the gunners equally
accurate.</p>

<p>Before five minutes had passed the main topmast of the
<i>Wasp</i> was shot away and hung tangled in the rigging.</p>

<p>The topmen, commanded by skillful middies, tried in
vain to clear away the wreck.</p>

<p>The Britishers cheered, and sang "God Save the King!"</p>

<p>The Americans, though getting the worst of the fight,
shouted out the chorus of "Yankee Doodle."</p>

<p>But when the third broadside fired by the <i>Frolic</i> tore
away the <i>Wasp's</i> gaff and main topgallant mast, it looked
as though Jones would lose the battle, and have to strike
his flag.</p>

<p>Not far away the <i>Lively Bee</i> was watching the encounter.</p>

<p>The privateer did not wish to interfere unless the
<i>Wasp</i> was in actual danger, for Captain Vernon had his
eyes on one of the merchantmen, which he hoped to secure
as a prize.</p>

<p>To an onlooker it appeared that the British had received
no damage.</p>

<p>The <i>Frolic</i> fired when on the crest of the wave and thus
tore away its adversary's rigging, while the <i>Wasp</i> waited
until in the trough of the sea.</p>

<p>The American's shot was aimed at the hull instead of
the rigging.</p>

<p>While the fight was raging the two vessels got close
together and fouled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Yardarm laid to yardarm, and at that very moment
the Americans poured in a terrific broadside.</p>

<p>The guns were not half loaded, for so close were the
vessels that in loading the rammers were shoved right
against the side of the <i>Frolic</i>.</p>

<p>The men grew almost frantic with excitement.</p>

<p>They shouted and sang, they cursed the Britishers, and
reviled the Union Jack.</p>

<p>The gunners of the <i>Frolic</i> had no time to return the
last broadside, for their ship swung around so that her
bow lay against the <i>Wasp's</i> quarter.</p>

<p>"Give 'em a volley!" cried Captain Jones as he just
escaped losing his head from the swinging of the <i>Frolic's</i>
bowsprit over the quarterdeck.</p>

<p>Not only one, but a second volley was fired, and the
deck of the enemy seemed to be swept clean.</p>

<p>Then the Americans shouted and cheered.</p>

<p>"Let us board her!" they cried.</p>

<p>The order was given, and the men swarmed aboard.</p>

<p>It was by no means a bloodless encounter, for the contestants
fought like demons, and many a brave sailor
breathed his last on that heaving deck.</p>

<p>But the Britishers could not stem the onrush of Americans,
and before long the Union Jack was struck and the
<i>Frolic</i> captured.</p>

<p>Hardly had a prize crew in charge of Lieutenant Biddle
been placed aboard of her, when the man on the lookout
sang out:</p>

<p>"The <i>Poietiers</i> is close at hand, and she is heavily
armed."</p>

<p>And even as he spoke the heavy boom of a gun was
heard.</p>

<p>The <i>Poietiers</i> had signaled the <i>Wasp</i> to lay to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Poietiers</i> carried seventy-four guns, and was a
formidable enemy.</p>

<p>Her great hull seemed to cast a shadow over the water,
and the jubilation of the Americans was hushed in the
solemnity of the coming contest.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Biddle saw the English war vessel bearing
down upon the <i>Frolic</i>.</p>

<p>He had hoped to take her into port, but his hopes were
rudely shattered by the appearance of the English frigate.</p>

<p>For he recognized her as the <i>Poietiers</i>, a British seventy-four
gun ship.</p>

<p>To fight was impossible, and to escape seemed equally
so.</p>

<p>Both the <i>Frolic's</i> masts had gone by the board within
a few minutes after the flag was struck.</p>

<p>At the very moment the man in the crow's-nest sighted
the <i>Poietiers</i>, the prize crew was working hard to clear
from her decks the dead bodies, wreckage, and tangled
mass of rigging, which made navigation impossible.</p>

<p>The sea was rough, the wind heavy.</p>

<p>The <i>Frolic</i> was tossed about in the trough of the sea,
a helpless mass.</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked over the billowy waters to see
if any help was at hand.</p>

<p>The <i>Wasp</i> had seen the <i>Poietiers</i> almost as soon as she
had been sighted by the <i>Frolic</i>.</p>

<p>Captain Jones examined his guns, and found that he
had no chance to fight successfully with the new enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Even had the <i>Wasp</i> been fresh and ready for battle,
the chances would have been slight, for the British frigate
was in every way the superior of the American sloop.</p>

<p>Jones sighed as he ordered the sails to be set for retreat.</p>

<p>It was better to run away than fight under such disadvantages.</p>

<p>But the sails, when shaken out, were found to have
been cut to pieces by the <i>Frolic's</i> shot.</p>

<p>"Beat to quarters!" shouted the captain.</p>

<p>The men understood that the <i>Wasp</i> would sting as long
as possible.</p>

<p>"Clear the deck for action!"</p>

<p>The Stars and Stripes was run up the halliards, and the
crew gave a hearty and lusty cheer, though they knew
their defeat and death were near.</p>

<p>The <i>Poietiers</i> sailed down upon the almost helpless
<i>Wasp</i>, and fired a broadside.</p>

<p>Captain Jones answered with another broadside. It
was plucky, and the Britishers were surprised.</p>

<p>They thought bulldog courage was only found under
the Union Jack.</p>

<p>The plucky commander of the <i>Wasp</i> tried hard to get
close to the <i>Poietiers</i>, so that he might board her.</p>

<p>He had resolved that it would be better for every one
of his men to die fighting than that they should be taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>But fate was against him.</p>

<p>The Britishers saw his object, and took every means
to prevent him achieving it.</p>

<p>Broadside followed broadside in rapid succession, and
further resistance was useless.</p>

<p>The triumph of the <i>Wasp</i> was short-lived, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
<i>Poietiers</i> did not feel much elated over its victory, for the
<i>Wasp</i> had made a gallant fight.</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> had watched the fight, unable to render
any effective assistance.</p>

<p>Captain Vernon had seen the merchantman, and as he
was cruising for revenue, as well as patriotism, he coveted
the rich prize.</p>

<p>"What do you make of her?" asked Vernon, as he
watched Tempest examine the brig.</p>

<p>"She is a rich prize, but armed."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and there are at least a dozen fighting men in the
crew."</p>

<p>"Can you see her name?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;wait a moment&mdash;yes, she is the <i>Caroline</i>, of
Bristol."</p>

<p>"The <i>Caroline</i>, of Bristol? Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite so. Why?"</p>

<p>"She is worth two hundred thousand dollars to us. I
know her cargo well. We must capture her."</p>

<p>"Can we?"</p>

<p>"We must. The <i>Frolic</i> is useless; the <i>Poietiers</i> has all
she can do to look after her prisoners. Our opportunity
will come."</p>

<p>"Captain, don't think me weak, but my heart beats most
violently when I look at that brig; why, I know not."</p>

<p>"It is not weakness. You are as brave as a lion,
Tempest; I know the feeling. The risk is great, the odds
against us, but I have a presentiment we shall win."</p>

<p>"God grant it."</p>

<p>Soon all was activity on board the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>Every preparation was made, but so secretly that not
even the strongest glass could discern much out of the
ordinary going on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>To the merchant captain the <i>Lively Bee</i> appeared to be
a schooner waiting about for any chance wreckage; or
merely with a desire to see the naval fight; for, as we
know, the privateer had a most innocent look.</p>

<p>"One broadside from the <i>Poietiers</i> will sink us," remarked
Tempest.</p>

<p>"Certainly, therefore I would not risk a fight until
night," answered Vernon.</p>

<p>Leaving the privateer, let us look at the merchantman,
whose fate was trembling in the balance.</p>

<p>As Vernon had said, the <i>Caroline</i> was one of the richest
prizes in American waters.</p>

<p>She was a stanch, trim brig, and as beautiful as any
picture.</p>

<p>In fact, so clean was her hull, so bright her deck, the
rigging was so new and perfect, that it was really hard
to believe she had buffeted the waves or encountered any
storms.</p>

<p>The captain, knowing the value of his cargo, had induced
the <i>Poietiers</i> to give him three small cannon and
half a dozen men.</p>

<p>"We may get parted, and then&mdash;I don't want to feel I
can make no resistance," he pleaded; and his plea was
graciously acknowledged.</p>

<p>But the <i>Caroline</i> carried a cargo that was not entered on
the manifest.</p>

<p>The captain had indulged in a little speculation of his
own, and, in his eyes, that one little bit of cargo, though
its weight could not have been more than a hundred and
twenty pounds, was more valuable than all the merchandise
put together.</p>

<p>As night approached, the <i>Poietiers</i> signaled the <i>Caroline</i>
to keep close, or no protection could be afforded.</p>

<p>Captain Carter of the good ship <i>Caroline</i> had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
cogitating for an hour or two as to whether he should
not try to make his trip alone.</p>

<p>He wanted to reach Jamaica, and he had been already
so much delayed that he was chafing at his slow progress.</p>

<p>So when the <i>Poietiers</i> ordered him to keep close, and
perhaps even follow the war ship for a few days longer,
Carter put his thumb to his nose and extended his fingers
in a most vulgar manner.</p>

<p>But then, the captain of the <i>Caroline</i> was not a refined
man.</p>

<p>He was young, and was a member of a good family,
but he had always been a black sheep, and his own friends
wondered that he had not turned pirate instead of merchant
skipper.</p>

<p>He was possessed of a very hot and ungovernable
temper, but would go to the extreme of kindness to those
he had bullied and ill-used when his temper subsided.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Poietiers</i> did not see the contemptuous
action of his merchant brother, and so signaled
again.</p>

<p>This time the flags were run up in reply:</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>It so happened that, dark as the night was naturally, it
was made worse and more unpleasant by a thick, damp
fog.</p>

<p>This was just what the <i>Lively Bee</i> wanted, but it reminded
Captain Carter so much of England that he cursed
the fog, and muttered some imprecation on the weather
and things in general.</p>

<p>Then he felt easier.</p>

<p>He descended to his cabin, but did not stay there long.</p>

<p>He wanted to see that his own special cargo was safe,
and for half an hour he was engaged in that occupation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>He was like a raving lunatic when he resought his own
cabin.</p>

<p>His cargo was human.</p>

<p>And a pretty piece of humanity it was.</p>

<p>With skin as pure as alabaster, with eyes brighter than
diamonds, and lips whose color would shame the rubies,
the girl stood defiantly in the center of the cabin.</p>

<p>She was a prisoner.</p>

<p>Carter had never seen so beautiful a woman before, or
at least had never seen one whose charms had so smitten
his heart.</p>

<p>He had met her on land, and at once laid siege to her
affections.</p>

<p>She was ladylike in her refusal of his affections; he
was persistent.</p>

<p>She had at last to threaten him with the vengeance of
her family if he did not leave her in peace.</p>

<p>He was exasperated.</p>

<p>Desperation made him determine to have her, by fair
means or foul.</p>

<p>When he saw she was firm in her refusal to listen to
him, he awaited his opportunity, and by means of a bribe
induced two fellows to abduct her and take her on board
his vessel.</p>

<p>She had been kept a prisoner for nearly a month, and
Carter wanted to hasten to Jamaica, where he could find
some clergyman who would perform the ceremony of
marriage, even though the bride was opposed.</p>

<p>The young lady had been particularly strong in her
language on the night of the fog.</p>

<p>"Captain Carter, I have told you I will never be your
wife. Touch me, dare to come within a yard of me, and
I will kill you as I would a snake. Force me to the altar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and, Heaven be my witness, I will kill myself before the
sacred shrine!"</p>

<p>There was so much earnestness in her manner that
Carter recoiled, muttering curses on her and womankind
in general.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A RICH PRIZE.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Captain Carter was mad. He had coveted the fair
woman and had stained his soul with crime's dark flood to
abduct her from her home and to his ship, and had hoped
that, when she saw how hopeless was her chance of escape,
she would forget her antipathy and consent to be
his wife.</p>

<p>He had tried every form of persuasion, had even promised
to leave the sea and settle on land, and as an extra
inducement had offered to abjure his country and become
an American citizen.</p>

<p>But only the more determined was the fair one to withstand
his wooing.</p>

<p>All this passed in review across his mind as he paced
his cabin uneasily.</p>

<p>He was wretched. Perhaps the constant blowing of
the fog horn added to his wretchedness, for there is nothing
more melancholy than the sound made by the human
breath when it passes through one of those instruments
of torture known as a fog horn.</p>

<p>"What now?" he asked angrily as the officer in charge
entered the captain's cabin.</p>

<p>"A boat is coming alongside, sir."</p>

<p>"A boat? Then it must be from the <i>Poietiers</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir, doubtless it is, unless it be from some
Yankee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>An angry scowl on the captain's face led his officer to
believe a hasty exit would be advisable.</p>

<p>Captain Carter was soon on deck.</p>

<p>The fog lay over the water with a darkness which
could almost be felt.</p>

<p>Only the slightest wind stirred the waves, and the captain
almost laughed at the thought of any enemy approaching.</p>

<p>He listened, but no sound smote upon his ear.</p>

<p>"I hear no boat, Gordon," he said. "Yet there is
something like the sound of oars, though there is no
noise of the rowlocks."</p>

<p>Gordon placed his partly closed hand before his mouth,
trumpet-fashion, and whispered the one word:</p>

<p>"Sweeps!"</p>

<p>Carter laughed harshly.</p>

<p>It was not a good sign when he indulged in a laugh,
and Gordon knew it.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by sweeps?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, cap'n, as to that, I saw a Yankee schooner lying
about all day a-watching us."</p>

<p>"You did? So did I. But you don't think any Yankee
would venture to touch us in the dark, and the <i>Poietiers</i>
so near?"</p>

<p>"As to that, cap'n, them Yanks can see in a fog, or the
dark, as well as in daylight, but I'm blessed if there isn't
a boat nearby."</p>

<p>Carter put his hands to his lips, and in a voice louder
than any fog horn, cried:</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy! where are you?"</p>

<p>There was a slight cessation of the sound of oars, but
no further notice was taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>And again, with the fullest force of his lungs, the captain
shouted:</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy! where are you going?"</p>

<p>An indistinct voice replied:</p>

<p>"What ship hails? Ahoy there!"</p>

<p>"Give me your name," cried Carter, "or I'll fire!"</p>

<p>A long laugh was distinctly heard by those on the deck
of the <i>Caroline</i>, followed by the question:</p>

<p>"What ship hails?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Caroline</i>, of Bristol," answered the captain.
"Your name?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Lively Bee</i>, privateer!" was the daring answer.</p>

<p>The merchant captain saw now that he was in danger.</p>

<p>His coolness forsook him, and he cursed his officers as
though they were to blame.</p>

<p>"On deck, all of you!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Make ready to repel boarders!"</p>

<p>Gordon took up the cry and repeated it, in tones loud
and stentorian, down the hatchway, adding various expletives
by way of emphasis.</p>

<p>The men came hurrying up the ladders, all excited and
angry at being disturbed.</p>

<p>They heard the regular dip of the oars, but the fog
was too dense for the <i>Lively Bee</i> to be seen.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Caroline</i>, armed with pistols and cutlasses,
awaited the enemy.</p>

<p>The cannon were of little or no use, for it was only a
waste of effort to fire at random, and the <i>Lively Bee</i> was
hidden from view.</p>

<p>Captain Vernon knew that the <i>Poietiers</i> was very
close, and so the less noise made the better.</p>

<p>He had said: "Use no pistols if you can help." And
the men answered in their cheery way: "Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>When the privateer was within a few yards of the
English brig her tall spars were for the first time visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>A fusillade of pistol shots rattled through the rigging,
but did no serious damage.</p>

<p>The privateersmen crouched below the bulwarks of
their taut little schooner until her bow passed over the
waist of the brig.</p>

<p>Then, with a ringing cheer, these daring men sprang
up and made a simultaneous leap into the <i>Caroline's</i> rigging.</p>

<p>They swarmed to her deck like a crowd of wasps, bent
on stinging their victims to death.</p>

<p>Cutlasses were vigorously used.</p>

<p>The sharp clang of steel was drowned at times by the
groans of the wounded, the quick crack of the pistols only
seemed like an accompaniment to the clashing of the cutlasses.</p>

<p>The Englishmen were driven back, not by weight of
numbers, but partly because they were taken unawares,
and most of them aroused from slumber.</p>

<p>But in prowess the crew of the privateer had also the
advantage.</p>

<p>They were born fighters, and every blow was given
with intent to kill.</p>

<p>Captain Carter had fought furiously, but had been
wounded fatally by a cutlass blow from John Tempest.</p>

<p>Nearly all the crew of the <i>Caroline</i> lay on the deck,
with wounds great or small.</p>

<p>It was a dismal sight, as the privateersmen moved
around with lanterns looking at the faces of the dead and
dying.</p>

<p>"Can there be any one below?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a cry, sir," answered Scarron.</p>

<p>"Ay, a woman's cry."</p>

<p>"Not likely that same, sir, asking your pardon for being
so bold, but women don't go to sea at times like
these."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must search the ship and report."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir; it is a great prize we have made."</p>

<p>"Can we get it to port, think you?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'd like to know, sir; it will be hard work,
for she must be a hundred and fifty ton heavier than the
<i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>"Double that, Scarron."</p>

<p>Mr. Tempest took a lantern and went down the companionway.</p>

<p>The captain's cabin was untenanted; but on the other
side of the gangway was another cabin, the door of
which was locked.</p>

<p>"Is any one in there?" shouted the young officer, but
received no answer.</p>

<p>"Open the door!" he shouted again, but still his command
was unheeded.</p>

<p>"Mr. Scarron, I feel sure there is some one in that
room. Can you break open the door?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>Mr. Scarron's foot was sent against the door with such
force that the panels were splintered, and even the frame
split asunder.</p>

<p>Tempest held up the lantern to look around the little
cabin.</p>

<p>"Great Heaven! A woman," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>And there, huddled upon the floor insensible, lay a female
form.</p>

<p>"Captain's wife!" muttered Scarron. "Poor woman,
she does not know she is a widow."</p>

<p>"She is too young to be his wife," said Tempest.
"Come, help me move her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she is dead."</p>

<p>"No, no, sir; I saw her hand move, and blow me, sir,
but she has a pretty hand; if only her face&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop that, Scarron; show me a light here. This is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
time for talk like that. We have all our work before us,
and but little time to do it."</p>

<p>While Mr. Scarron held the lantern, Lieutenant Tempest
raised the prostrate girl in his arms.</p>

<p>The light streamed across her face, and Tempest almost
dropped his burden.</p>

<p>A shriek-like exclamation burst from him.</p>

<p>"Bertha!"</p>

<p>He raised her still more, so that he could look closer
into her features.</p>

<p>"My God, am I dreaming?" he exclaimed, and then,
seeing Scarron's surprised face, he continued:</p>

<p>"This lady is my betrothed; but how she came here I
cannot say."</p>

<p>Scarron turned his head away, and muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! He has been deceived. Why will men
trust woman? She was false, as they all are."</p>

<p>Although Tempest recognized his betrothed, and his
heart naturally wished for her recovery, he dare not stay.</p>

<p>She had swooned, and nature would work her recovery.</p>

<p>He would not neglect his duty, and there was much to
be done, or the rich prize would be taken from them.</p>

<p>He returned to the <i>Lively Bee</i>, and after converse with
the captain it was resolved to run back to the nearest
port and take in the <i>Caroline</i>.</p>

<p>Already the fog was lifting, and the first rays of dawn
breaking through the night clouds.</p>

<p>The <i>Caroline</i> and <i>Lively Bee</i> must be many miles away
before morning came.</p>

<p>The crew was a small one, but to Tempest's great joy,
he found among the sailors of the <i>Caroline</i> five Americans
who had been impressed, and who were delighted at
the thought of sailing under the starry flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The sails were set, and though the risk of running
landward in such a fog was great, the two vessels attempted
it, and when the sun made its morning obeisance
to nature, and the beautiful rays of jeweled fire illumined
the ocean, Captain Vernon congratulated Tempest
on his capture, and rejoiced to think that the <i>Poietiers</i>
was not in sight.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A STRANGE SAIL.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And there, while thread shall hang to thread,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, let our ensign fly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noblest constellation set<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against our northern sky."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>The <i>Caroline</i> was one of the best ships in the British
merchant service.</p>

<p>She was as strongly built as a man-of-war, and in fact
could easily be transformed into a vessel of war.</p>

<p>The Union Jack of England still floated from her peak,
and Tempest had deemed it prudent not to lower it until
out of sight of the British squadron.</p>

<p>But now that the sun was shining, and no war ship
appeared above the horizon, he changed his mind.</p>

<p>"Haul down that flag, boys!" he shouted, and a dozen
willing hands were at the halliards.</p>

<p>The flag seemed endowed with life or reason.</p>

<p>For one moment it floated proudly and, as it seemed,
defiantly, then fell limp and dejected to the rope, never
once fluttering or showing sensibility to the breeze.</p>

<p>It lay on the deck, a prisoner of war, and in its place
there gradually arose that ensign of the free&mdash;the Stars
and Stripes.</p>

<p>The men cheered the rising flag, and Tempest, who
was in command of the <i>Caroline</i>, addressed the men most
eloquently:</p>

<p>"The flag of our nation is committed to your care," he
said. "Never let it be lowered by the hands of slaves or
of enemies. Let it float there, as long as one arm can
hold a cutlass to defend it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>And all the crew responded by giving a hearty cheer.</p>

<p>Tempest repaired to the cabin wherein he had left
Bertha Decatur.</p>

<p>She had aroused from her swoon, only to fall into a
deep slumber again.</p>

<p>She knew not whether the whole events of the night
had been but a dream, for her brain was confused.</p>

<p>She thought of the noise on deck, the shuffling of feet,
the clashing of steel, the muttered curses, the cries of the
wounded, and then all had become hushed. She had
fainted.</p>

<p>Was it a dream, or was it a terrible reality? If so,
what would be her fate?</p>

<p>She knew that Captain Carter would use no violence
other than forcing her to be his wife, and that she could
effectually resist by death.</p>

<p>And she was resolved to die rather than submit to such
a life.</p>

<p>Tempest knocked at the cabin door, which he had
roughly boarded up after Scarron's foot had done its
work so effectually.</p>

<p>But there was no response, and a message that Captain
Vernon was coming on board caused him to hasten to
the deck.</p>

<p>"The shock of your presence might be too much for
her," said Vernon. "Let me prepare Miss Decatur."</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Lively Bee</i> had only seen Bertha
once, and he did not think she would recognize him.</p>

<p>He knocked at the cabin door, and she bade him enter.</p>

<p>She started as she saw a stranger.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?"</p>

<p>"Miss Decatur, I am a stranger to you, but I would
like permission to say a few words to you."</p>

<p>"Proceed, sir; only, if you are here to plead his cause,
your words will be in vain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whose cause?"</p>

<p>There was a disdainful curve of the beauty's lips as
Vernon asked the question.</p>

<p>"Sir! there surely is no need of such assumed ignorance.
I am a prisoner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A prisoner&mdash;yes, but your captors mean you well."</p>

<p>Vernon misunderstood her meaning.</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"Wish me well&mdash;ay, perhaps so. The bird taken from
the wild freedom of the forest is cared for in its gilded
cage, but it prefers freedom, even with all its dangers."</p>

<p>"You are free, Miss Decatur&mdash;free as any one under
our flag can be."</p>

<p>"Under your flag, sir&mdash;yes! But your flag is one which
covers traitors and oppressors. Its every fold is dyed in
the blood of true patriots who have fought against it."</p>

<p>"You do not know&mdash;&mdash;" interrupted Vernon.</p>

<p>"Do I not? Have I not a brother who maimed himself
for life rather than fight under your flag?"</p>

<p>"You are wrong. The Stars and Stripes float from
the peak of this ship."</p>

<p>"Since when?" she asked, contemptuously, and, before
he could answer: "Since when have you learned to lie
and cheat for your captain's sake?"</p>

<p>"I am captain."</p>

<p>Bertha turned her back on the captain for a moment.
She was trying to quell the anger rising in her breast, for
she fully believed that Vernon had been sent as an emissary
from Carter.</p>

<p>"I have already given my answer to the captain," she
said. "Now leave me to my misery."</p>

<p>"What is the captain's name?" asked Vernon.</p>

<p>"Carter; if you insist on your catechetical insults."</p>

<p>"He is dead."</p>

<p>"Dead?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; do you not know that this ship was captured by
the Americans, and is now on her way to the nearest
port?"</p>

<p>"Are you speaking the truth?"</p>

<p>"As Heaven is my judge! Come on deck and you will
see the Stars and Stripes floating from the peak."</p>

<p>"If what you say is true, who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Harry Vernon of the <i>Lively Bee</i>, privateer, and
this vessel is under the command of my first officer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"You have met him before. He knows your brother
well."</p>

<p>"Does he?"</p>

<p>Bertha was still incredulous, and Vernon was more
than ever puzzled what to do with her.</p>

<p>She saw that he hesitated, and all her doubts returned.</p>

<p>"When shall we reach port?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Within twenty hours, if the winds are favorable."</p>

<p>"And how long would it take to reach Jamaica?"</p>

<p>"Forty-eight hours, or even more."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"Miss Decatur, I see you do not trust me. I will send
for one who may perhaps have more influence with you
than I have."</p>

<p>"If you do I shall kill myself," she exclaimed angrily.</p>

<p>"Shall you? We shall see."</p>

<p>He hastily wrote a line on a slip of paper and gave it
to a deckhand to deliver.</p>

<p>"I have sent for him," said Vernon.</p>

<p>"He will not see me alive."</p>

<p>Vernon saw she was desperate, and to prevent her carrying
out her threat he seized her hands.</p>

<p>"Unhand me! I am your prisoner, but I am a woman.
Let me die, for death would be better than a life such as
he proposes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be stupid, Miss Decatur, the man I sent for is
John Tempest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is false!"</p>

<p>But as she uttered the words Tempest entered the cabin.</p>

<p>"Bertha!"</p>

<p>"John! What does it all mean?"</p>

<p>Tempest had heard the last words uttered by Bertha,
and he was trembling violently.</p>

<p>"Do you hate me so much?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Hate you? No, I spoke of Captain Carter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of this ship?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What was he to you?"</p>

<p>"How can you ask? Do you not know that he visited
my home and professed to love me&mdash;that when I told him
I was engaged to another he declared I should never
marry any one but himself? My brother ordered him to
leave the house, and then, late that night, two men overtook
me as I was returning home; they gagged me and
carried me to a boat, from which I was taken to this ship,
which was in the offing."</p>

<p>"I thank Heaven I killed that captain! My friend,
here, is captain of the <i>Lively Bee</i>, privateer, and he has
captured this vessel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, Tempest. I did nothing of the kind. You
made the capture, for you led the assault, and you ran up
the Stars and Stripes."</p>

<p>"Let me see it," said Bertha, still almost doubting.</p>

<p>She walked up the companionway and stood on the
deck, the first time in nearly a month.</p>

<p>When her eyes looked upward and saw the American
flag proudly floating from the mast, she fell on her knees,
and in a loud voice thanked Heaven for her deliverance.</p>

<p>But her strength was overtaxed, and she fell back on
the deck in a fainting condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Tenderly Tempest carried her below and placed her on
the cabin lounge.</p>

<p>How he wished that there had been another woman on
board to attend to her wants; but wishes would not bring
one, and so he had to enact the <i>rôle</i> of nurse.</p>

<p>Mr. Scarron found three guns on board the <i>Caroline</i>,
but very little ammunition.</p>

<p>"Ask Captain Vernon to give you a few charges," said
Tempest, "for we may have to defend ourselves before we
reach port. And tell Captain Vernon that I shall not desert
the <i>Caroline</i> while there is the least chance of saving
her."</p>

<p>The day wore on apace, and all had good hopes that by
the morrow's morn an American port would be entered.</p>

<p>But the sun was just setting, its golden rays were
dancing on the green waters of the Atlantic, when Mr.
Scarron rushed unceremoniously into the cabin where
Tempest sat holding Bertha's hand in his own, and praying
for her return to consciousness.</p>

<p>"A sail! A strange sail, sir, and I believe she flies the
British flag. If so, she is armed. Come on deck, Mr.
Tempest, for, blow me, but I think we are in for a fight!"</p>

<p>The words fell so fast from Mr. Scarron's lips that he
was scarcely distinct, but Tempest's face paled, not with
fear for himself, but a precious life was now at stake, and
he feared everything for her sake.</p>

<p>Scarron reached the deck in a couple of bounds, and
again shouted:</p>

<p>"We are signaled to lay to, sir. What shall we do?"</p>

<p class="chaptitle">BOB, THE POWDER-MONKEY.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Their flag is but a rag,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Up with the Stars and Stripes!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down with the old one!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Tempest tore himself away from the side of Bertha
and leaped on deck.</p>

<p>He saw a sloop of war, flying the English ensign, between
the <i>Caroline</i> and the shore.</p>

<p>Quickly exchanging signals with the <i>Lively Bee</i>, a
course of action was agreed upon.</p>

<p>They must put out to sea.</p>

<p>The flight was attended with danger, for they might
fall in with larger war ships; the only chance they had
was to escape in the darkness of night.</p>

<p>"Stand by to get under way!" shouted John Tempest.
"The wind is rising, and methinks the <i>Caroline</i> can show
her heels as well as the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>The order was obeyed with alacrity, for the men loved a
fight, even though the odds were against them, and they
believed ere morning dawned they would smell powder.</p>

<p>The breeze ruffled the surface of the water around the
<i>Caroline</i>, breaking into myriads of little waves, which
leaped and danced and sparkled as the last rays of the sun
fell upon the ocean.</p>

<p>The sloop-of-war had signaled the <i>Caroline</i> and <i>Lively
Bee</i> to lay to, but no notice was taken.</p>

<p>Then the Britisher fired a gun, and Tempest ordered
the starry ensign to be dipped three times by way of
salute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>It was galling to the Englishman, and our young Yankee
intended it should be.</p>

<p>The sails were spread to the breeze; the jib which extended
along the bowsprit was hoisted, and the good ship
<i>Caroline</i>, bending low before the wind, moved along with
increasing velocity.</p>

<p>The sloop gained upon them.</p>

<p>"Set the gaff-topsails, and hoist away the spencer!"
shouted Tempest, and the men answered with a ready
obedience.</p>

<p>The spencer, with three small, triangular sails stretched
from the topmast, were now spread to the wind, giving
additional speed to the vessel.</p>

<p>Straining through every joint, the <i>Caroline</i> parted the
green waves before her, flinging the foam in feathery
showers around her bows.</p>

<p>The sloop was gaining even then, and Tempest saw that
they were in for a fight, unless darkness came on suddenly.</p>

<p>He heard his name called, and knew that Bertha was
awake.</p>

<p>He hastened down the companionway.</p>

<p>"What was that report, John?" she asked.</p>

<p>"A gun was fired."</p>

<p>"At this ship?"</p>

<p>"No, it was a signal."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Bertha, it is as well that you should know. We are
putting out to sea."</p>

<p>"Then you deceived me?"</p>

<p>"No, Bertha; but a man-of-war is chasing us."</p>

<p>"And we shall all be killed."</p>

<p>"I hope not. We shall have to fight."</p>

<p>"Not with me on board?" she asked, with a little frightened
scream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Seeing, my dear Bertha, that if you get off you will be
drowned, I am afraid you will have to endure the annoyance."</p>

<p>"But why go out to sea? Have I not had enough sea?"</p>

<p>"My dear Bertha&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't dear Bertha me!" and the little beauty stamped
her foot. "You ought to get to land as quickly as you
can, and not fly into greater danger."</p>

<p>The heavy boom of a gun startled her.</p>

<p>"Take me back to America, won't you, Mr. Tempest?"</p>

<p>"I would like to; but there is some fighting before us, I
am afraid."</p>

<p>He went on deck, not waiting to hear what new objection
she would raise, or fresh obstacle interpose.</p>

<p>To his great joy he found that there was a likelihood
of a very dark night, and neither British nor American
would care about a night engagement at sea.</p>

<p>"Shall we reply, sir?" asked Scarron.</p>

<p>"No; we cannot reach the sloop, and we cannot afford
to waste powder and shot."</p>

<p>"I found twenty kegs of powder in the hold, sir."</p>

<p>"You did? That is great!"</p>

<p>"So I thought, sir, and there are more shots than powder
on the <i>Lively Bee</i>, and we have a lot of nails on
board."</p>

<p>"I see; if you get at close quarters you would fire nails?"</p>

<p>"Why not, sir? They would kill a man just as well as
lead."</p>

<p>"You are right, but I don't want to fight at all if I can
help it."</p>

<p>"I understand, sir. I guess we shan't do much until
morning."</p>

<p>"Have everything in readiness."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The darkness increased so rapidly that it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to do any effective fighting, and as the <i>Lively Bee</i>
and <i>Caroline</i> would have to contend against a well-equipped
man-of-war, it seemed the height of imprudence
to attempt a surprise.</p>

<p>A boat was lowered from the <i>Caroline</i>, but no sooner
did it strike the water than a gun was fired from the English
vessel.</p>

<p>This was warning so significant that the boat did not
proceed on its trip, and yet Tempest wanted to communicate
with the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>"I tell you, sir, only a good swimmer could reach the
privateer safely," said Scarron.</p>

<p>"But who could swim that distance?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"There is Bob, the powder-monkey."</p>

<p>"Do you think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That he would go? Why, sir, Bob would let his head
be used as a rammer for a cannon if he thought he could
serve the Republic."</p>

<p>"Send him to me."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir."</p>

<p>A few minutes and a boy some fifteen years of age stood
before Lieutenant Tempest.</p>

<p>"Bob, are you a good swimmer?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>Bob's face lighted up with a smile, a smile which
quickly developed into a grin, which threatened to extend
from ear to ear.</p>

<p>He did not answer, but pulled his forelock.</p>

<p>Bob had no other name, for he was a foundling. One
night Scarron had discovered a wee might of humanity on
the doorstep of a deserted house in New York.</p>

<p>He picked up the child, told the constables of his find,
and they very good-naturedly declared that "those who
find should keep," so Scarron kept the boy, called him
Bob, and educated him in all the learning of the gutter.</p>

<p>Bob profited so well that before he was ten years old he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
could swear like a trooper, fight like a pugilist, climb a
flagpole with the smartest, swim like a fish, and do a very
great many other physical feats.</p>

<p>He could not read. He had never tried to write except
in his own peculiar manner, which no one else could understand.</p>

<p>His moral faculties were not overbright, but he believed
in some power; he had been taught that unless he told the
truth and acted honestly, God would take him to some
dungeon where the light of day never entered.</p>

<p>He was as faithful as any dog, and had an intense love
for Scarron, and secondarily for the starry banner, which
he fancied had some magic power for good.</p>

<p>Bob was not handsome; in fact, it would be very difficult
to find a plainer, or, to use very expressive language,
uglier, boy in a week's search.</p>

<p>Tempest looked at him, and asked again:</p>

<p>"Can you swim a mile?"</p>

<p>Had the officer said a knot, or so many fathoms, he
would have understood, but a mile was very vague.</p>

<p>"Is it a mile from York to Staten Island?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Yes, over five miles."</p>

<p>"Then I can do it, for I've swum to the island and back
without stopping."</p>

<p>"Bob, listen to me. I want to send a message to the
<i>Lively Bee</i>; I dare not send a boat, for the English gunners
would sink it. Could you carry it to Captain Vernon?"</p>

<p>"Is it heavy?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The thing you want me to carry."</p>

<p>Tempest laughed.</p>

<p>"It is a letter."</p>

<p>"Yah, I can do it."</p>

<p>"I wish you would."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are we going to fight in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. I'd like to know how many guns that vessel
has."</p>

<p>Tempest spoke to himself, and had no idea that Bob
heard him.</p>

<p>The letter to Vernon was written and placed in a well-corked
bottle to prevent its destruction.</p>

<p>This was tied around Bob's waist, and the boy lowered
himself noiselessly into the water.</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> was about half a mile from the <i>Caroline</i>,
and Bob was not many minutes in covering the distance,
for he was an expert swimmer.</p>

<p>The letter was read, and an answer prepared and placed
in the bottle.</p>

<p>Once more Bob was in the water, but not swimming.</p>

<p>He lay on his back and floated, for he wanted to think.</p>

<p>Thinking, with him, was a difficult operation and required
considerable scratching of his head.</p>

<p>To do this in the water was not the easiest thing, and
Bob took longer than usual to think.</p>

<p>"He'd like to know how many guns that skunk has,
would he? Well, I guess I can find out."</p>

<p>Bob arrived at this conclusion after five minutes'
thought.</p>

<p>The Britisher was distant a mile, the three vessels forming
a triangle.</p>

<p>Bob swam to the war ship, and waited to make sure he
was not discovered.</p>

<p>He caught hold of the chains and climbed up until he
could see the deck.</p>

<p>So silently did he move that not one of the men on deck
heard him.</p>

<p>He crawled along in the shadows, waited in hiding
until the watch passed, and then moved on again.</p>

<p>Bob knew more about a man-of-war than many a commodore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and his steps were guided by his instinctive
knowledge.</p>

<p>He stood examining a gun which was longer than any
he had ever seen, and his curiosity betrayed him.</p>

<p>One of the officers of the watch saw him.</p>

<p>Bob knew it, but was not afraid.</p>

<p>He turned quickly and seized the astonished officer by
the throat.</p>

<p>The fingers were like iron. They closed tightly on the
Englishman's throat, preventing him from crying out.</p>

<p>Two minutes and the officer was dead. Bob knew that
by his weight. Letting the man down gently, he pulled a
tarpaulin over him, and resumed his search as calmly as
though nothing had disturbed him.</p>

<p>He was lowering himself into the water when he accidentally
saw the English flag still flying at the stern.</p>

<p>"That ain't the right flag," he muttered, as he looked at
the Union Jack. "Blow me crazy, but if I'd got the Stars
and Stripes I'd put it there. Anyhow, that thing shan't
stay."</p>

<p>Bob could move about with the silence of a mouse. He
was barefooted, and so no footfall was heard.</p>

<p>Quietly he drew the halliards and lowered the flag.</p>

<p>The darkness aided him, or he would have failed.</p>

<p>He unfastened the flag and wound it around his body.</p>

<p>A piece of the halliard was cut off to tie the flag securely.</p>

<p>Bob was not yet satisfied.</p>

<p>He knew the direction of the captain's cabin, and he
must pay his respects.</p>

<p>Placing his thumb to his nose, he extended his fingers
and muttered:</p>

<p>"That's for you, cap'n."</p>

<p>One of the seamen was approaching, and Bob must
escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>He clambered over the bulwarks and reached for the
chains, but missed them.</p>

<p>He fell into the water with a loud splash.</p>

<p>"Man overboard!"</p>

<p>The cry was taken up by the deck watch.</p>

<p>Lanterns were lowered over the side, and an object
could be seen floating on the water a few yards away.</p>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>Three muskets were leveled at the swimmer, but Bob
was not going to be in the track of the shot.</p>

<p>He dived, and when he arose again to the surface he
was a good many points to the east, and was out of range
of their vision.</p>

<p>A new sensation diverted the attention of the crew.</p>

<p>"Murder!" shouted one of the watch, as he stumbled
over the dead body of the murdered officer.</p>

<p>The crew gathered around.</p>

<p>Captain Scott looked at the lieutenant's body and asked:</p>

<p>"Who has done it?"</p>

<p>"I found him there, sir," answered the man.</p>

<p>"I'll find out who has done this, and he shall pay for it.
Beat to quarters and let the roll be called."</p>

<p>The drums were beaten, and the men tumbled out of
their hammocks, expecting to be called upon to fight.</p>

<p>The middies called the rolls, and every man answered.</p>

<p>When this was reported to the captain, he glared with
savage wrath.</p>

<p>"Who, then, was that who leaped overboard?"</p>

<p>The mystery was greater than ever. Every man on
board believed the lieutenant to have been murdered by
one of the crew, who, to save himself from death by hanging,
had trusted himself to the waves, hoping to reach
one of the American vessels and be received as a deserter.</p>

<p>"What now, fellow?" roared the captain, as one of the
deck watch spoke excitedly to his officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Captain, this man tells me," said the middy, "that the
flag has been lowered and the halliards cut."</p>

<p>"Death and fury! I'll give every man of the night
watch a dozen lashes at the triangle in the morning.
Zounds! who could have lowered our flag?</p>

<p>"Find out, sir!" addressing the chief officer, "or I'll
report you as well. Fury! Has some Yankee boarded
the <i>Monarch</i>, and none know of it?"</p>

<p>Captain Scott, of his majesty's sloop-of-war <i>Monarch</i>,
was the angriest man in those waters that night.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MONARCH'S DOOM.</p>


<p>"He has failed, Scarron."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tempest had repeated that assertion several
times during the two hours that Bob was away.</p>

<p>"I fear so, and yet I never knew Bob to fail afore."</p>

<p>"But he has been gone so long."</p>

<p>"I guess he'll have a good showing when he does come.
Hello! what's that?"</p>

<p>Going to the bulwark, Scarron looked over, and in a
low voice uttered the nautical expression:</p>

<p>"Ahoy, there!"</p>

<p>Back came the answer:</p>

<p>"Toss me a rope."</p>

<p>"It is Bob!" cried Scarron. "A rope there, quick&mdash;the
boy's tired."</p>

<p>"Where away, sir?"</p>

<p>"Nor&mdash;nor'west."</p>

<p>The rope was thrown, and the direction was right, for
almost immediately it was grasped, and the men began to
haul it in.</p>

<p>A few moments and Bob, the powder-monkey, stood
on deck.</p>

<p>He was bewildered and faint with his great exertion.</p>

<p>Scarron gave him a good stiff glass of grog, and asked
for the message sent by the captain of the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>Bob laughed.</p>

<p>"Not likely. It's the cap'n as will get it, not you."</p>

<p>"What have you got on?" asked Scarron, for the first
time noticing the flag wrapped around the boy's body.</p>

<p>Bob grinned, but did not reply. But when Tempest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
approached, the boy pulled his forelock and began to untie
the rope.</p>

<p>When he had unwound several yards of it, and unfolded
the flag, Tempest asked:</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?"</p>

<p>Again Bob grinned, and that delayed the answer.</p>

<p>"You said you'd like to know how many barkers that
there Britisher had got, so I went and counted."</p>

<p>"You were on board the man-of-war?"</p>

<p>"Certain I was, or else how could I count?"</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it."</p>

<p>Tempest spoke almost angrily, for he had an idea that
Bob had acted treacherously, else how would it have been
possible for him to have wandered about the gun deck of
a well-ordered war ship?</p>

<p>The boy told of his adventures, and described the long
stern-chasing gun, and the death of the officer.</p>

<p>"It was this way," he said. "I'd got to kill him, or he'd
have killed me, and then who'd fight for the Stars?"</p>

<p>"But the flag?"</p>

<p>"I seen it flying," said Bob, more emphatically than correct,
"and, thought I, it's only a rag anyway, and I'll take
it to keep me dry. If I'd had a Starry flag, I'd have put
it up, but I hadn't, so they have to do without one."</p>

<p>The flag was examined and the name <i>Monarch</i> was
found on it.</p>

<p>The information given by Bob bore out the fact that
the sloop was his majesty's ship <i>Monarch</i>, carrying eight
guns, one of which was a stern-chaser capable of carrying
a long distance.</p>

<p>"Bob, you are a true hero."</p>

<p>"Am I?"</p>

<p>"You are, and when we get back to America I shall see
that the President hears of what you have done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blow me, cap'n, but a great man like he won't care
about a boy's swim; why should he?"</p>

<p>The letter from Vernon was read, and he agreed with
his lieutenant.</p>

<p>When morning dawned the British ship <i>Monarch</i> was
within half a mile of the <i>Caroline</i> and <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>The Britisher swung around so that she could bring her
long gun in line with the <i>Caroline</i>.</p>

<p>Tempest saw his danger, and swung around at the same
time, while the <i>Lively Bee's</i> long gun was aimed straight
at the <i>Monarch's</i> mainmast.</p>

<p>The stern-chaser belched forth, and the shot tore across
the water, but missed the <i>Caroline</i>.</p>

<p>At the same time a return shot was fired, much to the
Britisher's surprise, by the <i>Lively Bee</i>, and a good-sized
splinter was taken off the mast.</p>

<p>The battle had now commenced in good earnest, although
it was all on one side, for the guns possessed by
the <i>Caroline</i> were of too short a range to do any damage
at such a distance.</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> was bent on disabling the <i>Monarch</i>, and
a second time the long gun was sighted for the mainmast.</p>

<p>A loud cheer arose from the <i>Caroline's</i> crew, as they
saw the mainmast cut in two by the shot and go crashing
over the side.</p>

<p>The privateer was keeping the war ship active, and diverting
attention from the <i>Caroline</i>.</p>

<p>This was just what Tempest had planned. It gave him
an opportunity to get in close alongside the <i>Monarch</i>.</p>

<p>Then his voice rang out:</p>

<p>"Give her a broadside!"</p>

<p>The guns belched forth, and the shots tore up the deck
of the enemy's forecastle, killing two men, breaking a
middy's arm, and slightly injuring the bowsprit.</p>

<p>Another broadside quickly followed, and before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
smoke had cleared away, Tempest ordered the men to
seize their grapnells and board.</p>

<p>Cutlasses and boarding-pikes were passed from hand
to hand along the deck, and Tempest, drawing his sword,
waved it above his head, shouting to his men to follow
him.</p>

<p>"Have at them, boys," he shouted, "to the death!"</p>

<p>He rained blows right and left, which no one could
parry.</p>

<p>Captain Scott sought out the brave lieutenant, and
with eyes flashing like those of a snake he struck at the
young officer with a savageness amounting to fury.</p>

<p>But Tempest was on his guard.</p>

<p>With a fierce and determined energy he met the British
captain, and sent his sword twice through his arm, rendering
it entirely useless.</p>

<p>"Do you surrender?" asked Tempest as the sword fell
from the captain's hand.</p>

<p>"No, you Yankee dog, a Briton never surrenders except
to death!"</p>

<p>With his left hand Scott drew a pistol and leveled it,
but with a swinging blow from Tempest's sword, which
severed the captain's wrist, the pistol and hand dropped to
the deck.</p>

<p>"Surrender!"</p>

<p>"Never!" Then, turning to his crew, he shouted:
"Boys, never give in! Fight till you die. Whip the Yankees
or die in the attempt!"</p>

<p>But, though thus encouraged, the men could not hold
out.</p>

<p>The ship was so badly injured that it rolled about unmanageable,
and when the captain died, as he did a few
minutes later, the men surrendered, and the <i>Caroline</i>
claimed the <i>Monarch</i> as a prize.</p>

<p>The ship was too much disabled to take into port, so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
under the direction of Scarron, the guns were removed to
the <i>Caroline</i>, together with a good portion of the ammunition.</p>

<p>When this was accomplished and the prisoners transferred,
the order was given to blow up the war ship.</p>

<p>A terrific report which caused the waters to be troubled
as though by an earthquake, and all was over with his
majesty's sloop-of-war <i>Monarch</i>.</p>

<p>"Now to port!" shouted Tempest, obeying the signal
of the <i>Lively Bee</i>, and the men joyously spread the sails
and cheered as they filled out with the wind, for they knew
they were bound for home.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HOMEWARD BOUND.</p>


<p>"Do not undress; be ready at any moment to go to
quarters."</p>

<p>Such was the command given the men who were sent
below to sleep, after the watch was set for the night.</p>

<p>Tempest was not anxious for sleep, although he had
been up all the previous night.</p>

<p>He had sent word to Bertha that if she liked to walk
the deck with him, he should be pleased to have her company.</p>

<p>The lady was delighted.</p>

<p>She could not sleep, and the air of the little cabin was
stifling.</p>

<p>She had been too much afraid to go on deck during the
day, and had no real knowledge of the great events which
had transpired.</p>

<p>Flushed as Tempest was with victory, he yet hesitated
to tell Bertha all that had transpired, for war is no fit
subject for feminine ears.</p>

<p>But she was fit to be a soldier's wife. Full of patriotic
zeal, the overthrow of the British was a subject she rejoiced
to hear spoken of; and when her own lover was
the hero, her delight was beyond all computation.</p>

<p>The sails of the <i>Caroline</i> filled at the first puff of wind,
and she kept at hailing distance with the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>"Where are we bound now?" asked Bertha as she paced
the deck, her hand on Tempest's arm.</p>

<p>"Home!" was the answer.</p>

<p>"To stay?"</p>

<p>Instead of answering, Tempest said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are at war with England. That country has destroyed
some of our cities and is devastating our land.
She has claimed the supremacy of the ocean, as you know.
We have disputed her right. Now what is my duty? My
great ancestor left England in the <i>Mayflower</i>; he founded
a family unexcelled for its patriotism. His descendants,
by marriage, united the great tribes of the Indians with
the white people. My father fought with Greene at
Bunker Hill and with Washington at Valley Forge. What
is my duty?"</p>

<p>Bertha Decatur did not hesitate in her answer.</p>

<p>"My brave boy, you must fight&mdash;until the end."</p>

<p>"I thought you would say so. But do you know what
you told me when I asked for this little hand?" asked
Tempest, placing his hard hand on her soft one.</p>

<p>"I said I would only marry a hero."</p>

<p>"And now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say the same."</p>

<p>"What constitutes a hero in your estimation?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I can tell you the name of one; he is
my ideal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned away her head to hide her crimson blushes.</p>

<p>"What is his name, and I will try to imitate him."</p>

<p>Her hand trembled on his arm.</p>

<p>"Is it your uncle, the captain?" he asked.</p>

<p>She murmured so low that he almost thought he misunderstood
her, for the name he heard was his own.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"You know I do. Have you not known it long, long
ago?"</p>

<p>"I hoped, and yet I feared&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You should not fear."</p>

<p>"Then, Bertha, dear, will you&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated for a
few moments. Her hand trembled, her face was turned
away. "Will you become my wife as soon as we land?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am your prisoner, sir, and prisoners are not usually
consulted about their future," she answered mischievously.</p>

<p>"But I heard a lady say that if, as a prisoner, she was
taken to the altar, she would kill herself."</p>

<p>"But her captor was English."</p>

<p>"Then any American who might capture you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have taken me prisoner, and if you cannot keep
me, why&mdash;why, the bravest man shall have me. So there!"</p>

<p>"I do not fear now; and, Bertha, the first thing we will
do when we reach land will be to get married."</p>

<p>"What noise is that?" she suddenly asked. "Is it not
horrible?"</p>

<p>"Hush! you must not say that. It is the men below
who are singing. If the hatchways were open you could
hear the words."</p>

<p>As though one of the watch had heard the officer's
words, the hatches were thrown back, and the gruff voices
of the men, who were too excited to speak, were heard
singing:</p>

<p>"Who is Vernon?" asked Bertha.</p>

<p>"The bravest and truest man who ever wore a blue
jacket. The captain of the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>"But he is a privateer."</p>

<p>"So am I. I entered his crew as a man before the mast.
He made me first officer. He searched me out, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
your brother knew me. Vincent told him my story, and
Vernon has given me a chance to win you, my darling."</p>

<p>"Hem! Ha! Ugh! Beg parding, sir, but my mate on
the lookout says as how he sees a strange sail, which is
kinder suspicious."</p>

<p>The man had crept up quietly behind the lovers and had
tried to attract their attention by his coughing and strange
noises.</p>

<p>"I will go forward, Smithson."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!" Then to himself he muttered: "He's a
good sort, too good for a privateer; he ought to be on a
reg'lar man-o'-war, or better'n that, a whaler away down
in the Suthern seas. Blow me, but I like whalin' better'n
fightin', I do."</p>

<p>"Go below, Bertha, and try and get some sleep. No
one shall disturb your solitude, and I want some rose-bloom
on your cheeks when you reach land, you know."</p>

<p>Bertha Decatur went to her cabin, for the first time
wishing that her lover was anything but a fighting man.
The danger was so great.</p>

<p>"I can pray for him," she said, "and who knows, mayhap
prayers will save his life."</p>

<p>"A sail, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Ay ay, sir, and suspicious, too. She has a narrow
head to her topsails, and looks like a Frenchman."</p>

<p>"Where away?"</p>

<p>Far away on the horizon, where the light was fast waning,
a little white speck appeared, hardly visible to the
naked eye, but quite plain through a glass, was a large
ship on the port tack in cruising canvas only.</p>

<p>"What do you think&mdash;is she too big for us to tackle?"
asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"I am afraid so, sir."</p>

<p>"Where is the <i>Lively Bee</i>?"</p>

<p>The privateer was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>How had they missed her?</p>

<p>Surely no accident had happened to her; if so, signals
would have been fired.</p>

<p>"There she is, sir, far away to the west'ard."</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> had outdistanced the <i>Caroline</i>, and was
only dimly visible in the twilight.</p>

<p>"Spread all sails! Let us overtake the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir&mdash;but the vessel yonder?"</p>

<p>It was evident the man was in favor of stopping to
fight, and the <i>Caroline</i> was in good fettle as regards guns,
for she had transferred those from the <i>Monarch</i>.</p>

<p>But Tempest never forgot that he was sailing under
Captain Vernon, and whatever his own inclination, he
would take no action without consultation with his chief.</p>

<p>"Haul your fore-sheet to windward!" he shouted to the
men in the forecastle. "Right your helm, quartermaster.
We must show our heels to the enemy for once."</p>

<p>On went the <i>Caroline</i>, as fast as the wind would carry
her.</p>

<p>All was bustle on her deck, for all knew that unless
they could outdistance the ship which was looming up in
the fast darkening twilight, larger than ever, there would
be no escaping a fight.</p>

<p>"That is the <i>Macedonian</i>, sir," said Scarron, touching
his cap as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and we stand no chance if she gets within
gunshot. The <i>Caroline</i> and <i>Lively Bee</i> will change flags,
and one and all our men will get sent to Dartmoor prison."</p>

<p>"Then we must fly."</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, fly like the wind, or faster than the wind. See,
the <i>Lively Bee</i> is coming back."</p>

<p>"Bless you, Vernon!" exclaimed Tempest aloud, "you
never deserted a friend yet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Mr. Tempest, and Harry Vernon never will. I
can answer for that," said Scarron, thinking that his officer
had spoken to him.</p>

<p>The night was coming on apace, and Tempest hoped
that he might get near enough the shore before morning
to make attack dangerous.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and the <i>Lively Bee</i> was within hailing
distance.</p>

<p>"Is that the <i>Macedonian</i>?" asked Vernon.</p>

<p>"I think so, captain."</p>

<p>"Then we must show our heels, or go to Davy Jones'
locker."</p>

<p>"That is just what I had ordered, sir. We must save
the rich prize."</p>

<p>A light was seen to the westward, and Vernon muttered
something like a curse, for he knew the signal to
be from a man-of-war.</p>

<p>"Between two fires, Tempest. Only Heaven can save
us!" he shouted.</p>

<p>And the brave lieutenant replied:</p>

<p>"In God we'll trust, sir."</p>

<p>But all the same, Tempest felt very anxious, for he
had on board the one he loved better than life.</p>

<p>"In God we'll trust!" said Tempest, and Bertha Decatur
drew nearer to him, as she whispered lovingly:</p>

<p>"He will protect us!"</p>

<p>Then, with a feminine fear, she asked:</p>

<p>"Do you think we shall have to fight?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid so; but if we do&mdash;can you be brave, my

<p>"Tell me what it is you fear."</p>

<p>"If we fight we shall be beaten. Against such as yon
ship we have no chance. And if the other is a Britisher,
we are doomed."</p>

<p>"Let me die with you."</p>

<p>"We may not be killed."</p>

<p>Bertha looked at her betrothed, her lips quivering and
her body trembling, not with fear, but rather with the
thought that her life might be so short, now that she had
begun to realize how well it was worth living.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you will never surrender?" she asked proudly.</p>

<p>"What would you wish, Bertha?"</p>

<p>"Wish? Why, better die than be a prisoner; better give
your life for your flag, than live dishonored. We can die
together&mdash;it would be better."</p>

<p>The man at the masthead shouted:</p>

<p>"Sail, ho!"</p>

<p>Tempest left Bertha, and exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Masthead, there!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>"Where away is the sail?"</p>

<p>The direction was given. It was the sail seen between
the <i>Caroline</i> and the shore.</p>

<p>"What does she look like?"</p>

<p>"A square-rigged vessel, sir."</p>

<p>After a few minutes Tempest again shouted:</p>

<p>"Masthead, there!"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"What flag does she fly?"</p>

<p>There was a silence deep and profound as the answer
was awaited.</p>

<p>"She shows no colors, sir! She is a large ship and
bearing down upon us. The Britisher is gaining on us
as well."</p>

<p>For a moment only did the brave young officer hesitate.</p>

<p>It was a bright, sunshiny morning and the air was clear.</p>

<p>"Run up the starry banner!" he shouted.</p>

<p>It was a defiance, and the crew cheered heartily as the
flag ran up the halliards.</p>

<p>But the cheering suddenly ceased at a word from the
commander.</p>

<p>"Masthead, what do you see?"</p>

<p>Scarcely a minute elapsed before the answer came.</p>

<p>"She has run up the American flag, sir!"</p>

<p>What cheering!</p>

<p>What joy filled the breasts of the crew!</p>

<p>Orders were given to stand toward the American.</p>

<p>"What name does she bear?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"The <i>United States</i>," came the answer after a few
minutes.</p>

<p>"How strange! What will Bertha say?" thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Tempest, for the <i>United States</i> frigate was commanded
by her uncle, Captain Decatur.</p>

<p>On board the <i>United States</i> everything was being put
in order for a naval battle.</p>

<p>Decatur called his officers together.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, we have to fight this Sabbath morning instead
of worshiping. I want you to tell all your men
that the conflict will be severe; but that the flag of my
country on the ship I command shall never leave the staff
on which it waves as long as there is a hull to support it."</p>

<p>The officers saluted as became men of their rank, but
one middy was far too excited to merely salute.</p>

<p>He threw up his cap and shouted:</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Captain Decatur!"</p>

<p>Thus challenged, the officers responded, and never did
men give more hearty cheers than those officers of the
U. S. frigate <i>United States</i>.</p>

<p>There were a number of youths on board the American
ship whose ages were from twelve to fourteen.</p>

<p>Many a lad, at that time, received his warrant as a
midshipman while still in his tenth year.</p>

<p>If he was tall and well formed no questions were asked,
but if below the ordinary stature he was interrogated
closely.</p>

<p>It was illegal to enroll any boy's name on the roster,
unless he had passed his twelfth birthday.</p>

<p>Jack Creamer wanted two weeks to be ten years old,
but he was allowed to stay on board.</p>

<p>When Jack saw the English frigate approaching he
looked troubled.</p>

<p>No one would have thought he was so young, for his
face looked pinched and wan.</p>

<p>"Cowardly, cowardly, custard!" sneered one of the middies
who had managed to get enrolled, though only eleven
years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am no coward," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Of course not," responded another middy; "not a coward,
only a little bit scared like. No wonder, you are only
a child."</p>

<p>"I'm nearly as old as you," retorted Jack.</p>

<p>"Are you? I'm an officer in the United States navy,
while you are too young to be enrolled."</p>

<p>So they rallied Jack, and he became indignant.</p>

<p>Something worried him.</p>

<p>No one imagined in his heart that Jack was afraid, but
boys like to tease each other, and even middies are no exception
to the rule.</p>

<p>An old quartermaster watched Jack closely.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Jack?" he asked kindly.</p>

<p>"I would like to see the captain before going into
action."</p>

<p>"You shall, my boy. Come now."</p>

<p>He took Jack Creamer up to the quarterdeck, and there
waited for Captain Decatur's attention.</p>

<p>The captain turned and saw the two, and in his cheery
voice asked:</p>

<p>"What is wanting now, Jack?"</p>

<p>The boy saluted, and in a quivering voice replied:</p>

<p>"Commodore, will you please to have my name put
down on the muster roll?"</p>

<p>"Why, what for, my lad? You are far better as you
are."</p>

<p>Jack had grown bold.</p>

<p>He pointed to the British ship, which was almost within
gunshot range, and replied:</p>

<p>"So that I can draw my share of the prize money, commodore,
when we take that Britisher."</p>

<p>"Your name shall be entered, Jack."</p>

<p>The lines left the boy's face, a brightness came to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
eyes, and he left the captain's presence far from decorously,
for it was with a hop, skip and a jump.</p>

<p>Decatur directed the attention of the masthead man to
the strange sails to the leeward.</p>

<p>"She flies the American flag," was the answer.</p>

<p>"And the other to the north of her?"</p>

<p>"I'd know her anywhere."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"She's all right. As tight a little boat as ever sailed.
The <i>Lively Bee</i>, privateer."</p>

<p>"We shall have friends, then."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir. Cap'n Vernon is as stanch as his boat,
an' that's sayin' a lot."</p>

<p>"Beat to quarters."</p>

<p>How willingly the men obeyed! How quickly each man
was at his post!</p>

<p>The surgeon in the cockpit got his instruments and
bandages ready, the powder-monkeys were in line, the
middies strutted about every bit as proud as peacocks,
and all the officers waited for the action to commence.</p>

<p>The first gun fired was from the American ship.</p>

<p>The ships were rolling in a manner fatal to good aim.</p>

<p>Half an hour was devoted to throwing away good ammunition,
for no other object was gained.</p>

<p>A terrific shout went up from the Yankees as they saw
that the Englishman's mizzen topmast was shot away.</p>

<p>Captain Carden soon saw that his men could not cope
with the Americans at such long range, so, with that bulldog
courage which Britishers possess, he disdained all
maneuvering and bore straight down on the enemy.</p>

<p>Both began to fire broadsides, and the firing from the
American was so rapid that the <i>Macedonian's</i> crew
shouted:</p>

<p>"She's on fire! Hurrah for England and her hearts
of oak!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>But they had shouted too soon.</p>

<p>A well-aimed shot cut away the mizzenmast, which fell
alongside, suspended by the cordage.</p>

<p>"Hurrah, Jack Creamer!" shouted a captain of a gun
to the lad, whose face was as black as the ace of spades,
from the powder and smoke.</p>

<p>"Huzza, cap'n!" responded Jack. "You've made a brig
of her."</p>

<p>Captain Decatur heard the boy's remark and added
cheerily:</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, my lad! Now let the next shot make a sloop
of her."</p>

<p>Decatur was everywhere.</p>

<p>His activity was almost marvelous.</p>

<p>It seemed almost impossible that one man could accomplish
so much and continue to be so cheerful.</p>

<p>"Ay, I guess it would do her good," he said, as he saw
a gunner look along his gun.</p>

<p>"Did you speak to me, cap'n?"</p>

<p>"If you like; I saw you point your gun at the yellow
streak. Aim just there, let us hull her."</p>

<p>The order was passed along the gun deck, and each
gunner strove to see that his gun did the most damage.</p>

<p>The great missiles tore cruel holes in the <i>Macedonian's</i>
wooden walls, and so rapid was the firing that the Britisher
had no chance.</p>

<p>The flag was hauled down, and a ringing cheer from
the Americans crowned the victory of that Sunday.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE STORY OF THE FIGHT.</p>


<p>Lieutenant Allen was sent on board the prize.</p>

<p>He found the decks in a fearful condition.</p>

<p>The hauling down of the flag had turned the survivors
into veritable demons.</p>

<p>They broke open the hatches and got to the rum.</p>

<p>Some of the crew were already drunk, others nearly so.</p>

<p>Some were throwing the dead overboard, and with a
heartlessness which was horrible were even serving the
wounded the same way.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Allen was examining the muster rolls of
the <i>Macedonian</i> when a sailor pushed his way toward the
quarterdeck.</p>

<p>"I am an American, sir! 'Pressed against my wishes,
and there were seven more of us."</p>

<p>"Where are the others?"</p>

<p>"Three are dead, sir, the others want to be taken into
your crew."</p>

<p>"And you fought against your country?"</p>

<p>"We had to do it, sir."</p>

<p>"You should have begged to go below."</p>

<p>"We did, and were ordered to the guns or to be treated
as mutineers."</p>

<p>"I will see what can be done."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. We shall be happier fighting for our
own flag."</p>

<p>When the first boat was filled the first lieutenant of the
<i>Macedonian</i> insultingly asked Lieutenant Allen if he was
to lose his baggage.</p>

<p>"We are not privateersmen," answered Allen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not know what you are," sneered the Englishman.</p>

<p>A powder-monkey on board the <i>Macedonian</i> told the
story of the fight so graphically that Decatur sent for him
and begged him to recount it once again.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Samuel Leach, sir, as good a Briton as ever carried
powder to a gun."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it. Will you tell me what you know
of the battle?"</p>

<p>"If your honor would like to hear it."</p>

<p>"I am waiting."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I don't know as how you would care about
hearing about what we thought of you when we saw you
bearing down on us."</p>

<p>"Of course you were confident of victory?"</p>

<p>"That's true. And many a bet we made as to the
amount of prize money we'd receive. You see, your
honor, the men who gets most of the fighting, and who
have to work the hardest, gets the least of the prize
money. But when your boat fired I heard such a strange
noise. It was like the tearing of sails just above our
heads. That's the Yankee wind, said I, and so it was.</p>

<p>"My, how the cannon did roar! Both sides were hard
at it, and made a most hideous noise.</p>

<p>"Then I heard the shots strike the sides of our ship,
and the timbers flew in pieces like kindling wood.</p>

<p>"It was my first battle, and I trembled at the noise.</p>

<p>"Presently I saw the blood fly suddenly from the arm
of a man serving at my gun. I don't know what hit him,
but there was the blood.</p>

<p>"I hadn't much time to look around, for the boys belonging
to the guns next to mine were all wounded, and
I had to serve four guns. And that was hard work.</p>

<p>"My chum, Harry Lanyon, was serving at the next
gun to me, and I saw a great ball strike him on the leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Before he could be moved, the boy at the next gun
had some canister sent through his ankle.</p>

<p>"A stout Yorkshireman lifted the boys, one after the
other, and carried them to the cockpit. Each had to
lose a leg.</p>

<p>"Then I rushed on deck. I was made frantic with
what I had seen.</p>

<p>"I ran up to Tom Smithers&mdash;your honor didn't know
Tom, but he was one of the bravest men that ever lived.
Tom sprang forward to bid me go back to my duty, but
before he could finish what he was saying he was cut
clean in two by a terrible shot.</p>

<p>"Then I saw Middy Davis. Oh, sir, he was a bright
boy&mdash;not as old as I am by a year or so. How his
mother cried when we left Bristol, and how he tried to
comfort her by saying he would bring back lots of prize
money.</p>

<p>"Well, sir&mdash;captain, I mean&mdash;the young middy ordered
us about just like an old man. He was so brave, and
knew his duty.</p>

<p>"What did he do but jump on a gun and shout: 'Are
we not Englishmen? Doesn't Britain rule the waves?
Are we going to be beaten by a pack of Yankees?' Them's
his words, sir, or I wouldn't repeat them, for you can't
help being Yankees. Well, sir, as true as I'm a living
sinner, he had scarcely said the words when a cannon
ball took off his head just as clean as a sword cut. Poor
chap, you wouldn't have thought he was good-looking,
but he was. Then the lieutenant seeing me, shouts:</p>

<p>"'Leach, throw that thing overboard!' and he pushes
the head along the deck as though it was a ball.</p>

<p>"A point abreast of the mainmast we called the slaughter
house, 'cause so many were killed just there.</p>

<p>"There, sir, a ball entered a port and killed five men
at one lick. It was horrible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"I got so as I didn't mind slipping about in the blood,
but I was glad when I heard the order given to stop
firing, and I knew we were licked.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be alive and a prisoner than be dead, sir,
so I would; but I've had enough fighting, and Sam Leech
will never fight again if he knows what he's about."</p>

<p>Close behind Sam Leech stood Jack Creamer, who
had come to the captain's cabin with a message, but had
been so interested in the English boy's story that he had
forgotten where he was, and only knew that he was listening
to a good story.</p>

<p>"And you won't fight again?" he asked, giving Sam a
friendly slap on the back.</p>

<p>"No, I'm blessed if I will!"</p>

<p>"Do you know why?" asked Jack, not noticing Lieutenant
Allen, who was motioning him to be silent.</p>

<p>"I've had enough of it," answered Sam.</p>

<p>"You're on the wrong side, that's what's the matter.
Why, Sam, if you were on this ship you wouldn't be
tired."</p>

<p>"It seems you didn't get any damage done."</p>

<p>"Not much; only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jack, what can I do for you?" interrupted the captain.</p>

<p>The boy was so elated that, instead of answering Captain
Decatur's question, he grinned, showing all his teeth,
and said:</p>

<p>"We did take her, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy."</p>

<p>"I knew we should before we gave her the first broadside."</p>

<p>"Did you? Well, you will get your share of prize
money. What will you do with it?"</p>

<p>"How much will it be, your honor?"</p>

<p>"It may be two hundred dollars."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack's face lighted up with joy, for such a sum seemed
great wealth to him.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, I'd send half of it to my mother, and the
rest will get me a bit of schooling when the war is over."</p>

<p>"Bravely said, Jack," responded the captain, warmly.</p>

<p>The interview ended abruptly, for the officer of the
watch reported that a strange vessel was signaling.</p>

<p>"What does she want?"</p>

<p>"To speak with us."</p>

<p>"Well, find out what it is about."</p>

<p>Presently the report came that a boat was being put off
from the <i>Caroline</i>.</p>

<p>"Lay to," ordered the captain.</p>

<p>It was true.</p>

<p>Tempest had sent a boat to the gun ship, and with it a
message which sounded strange to Captain Decatur.</p>

<p>"Will Captain Decatur of the U. S. man-of-war <i>United
States</i> accept an invitation to visit the <i>Caroline</i>, which was
captured from the British by the <i>Lively Bee</i>, privateer?
The reason is too important to be intrusted to paper."</p>

<p>Captain Decatur, like many sea dogs, and man-of-warsmen
in particular, was very expressive in his language
when excited.</p>

<p>In fact, it seemed that the uttering of anathemas formed
a safety valve for his temper.</p>

<p>It was noticed that after such an outburst he was as
gentle as a lamb.</p>

<p>When he read the unsigned letter he was furious.</p>

<p>"Am I captain? Am I sub-acting commodore? And
should a privateersman order me about, and not even give
his name? No, no, sir. Go back to your captain and tell
him that an insult to me is an insult to the flag. I'll not
see him. I'll not take any notice of him. It may be all
a plot to capture me."</p>

<p>We have transcribed the substance of the message sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
back to the <i>Caroline</i>; the real message would not look well
in print, and certainly would not read well in a refined
assembly.</p>

<p>The boat started back to the <i>Caroline</i>, and Decatur
shouted another volley of anathemas at the receding crew.</p>

<p>Had the men sent by Tempest known the captain better,
they would have waited until the explosion had passed off,
and then they would have had another message to take
back.</p>

<p>"Lower a boat!" he cried, when the <i>Caroline's</i> boat
was nearly back. "Row me over to that vessel. I'll
show them that I cannot be insulted with impunity."</p>

<p>Tempest had no intention of insulting so gallant an officer,
but he was afraid to use his own name, for fear the
captain would think it unbecoming to acknowledge a man
who had resigned from the navy.</p>

<p>At the same time that the boat put off from the <i>United
States</i>, one left the <i>Lively Bee</i>, and the distance being
shorter, the latter reached the <i>Caroline</i> first.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas to you, Tempest!" exclaimed Harry
Vernon, as he leaped on deck.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten what day it was, but the same compliment
to you, sir."</p>

<p>Tempest soon explained the awkward situation to Vernon,
who undertook to pacify the angry naval officer.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MARRIAGE AT SEA.</p>


<p>To Vernon's astonishment, he recognized Decatur in
the boat.</p>

<p>No sooner did he recognize the honor than he ordered
a salute to be fired, and the flag dipped.</p>

<p>The naval officer swung himself on deck, and eyed
Vernon for a moment before speaking.</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Harry Vernon, Captain Decatur, and I welcome you
to as fine a prize as was ever taken from an enemy."</p>

<p>"My stars! And did your little schooner capture this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captain, and these guns bear the name of his
Britannic majesty's <i>Monarch</i> on them. That made prize
number two."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you. Your crew will be rich. But
why did you want to see me? Why, zounds, sir, did you
neglect to sign your name?"</p>

<p>Vernon, instead of replying, said, calmly:</p>

<p>"Captain Decatur, we captured more than you see.
The captain of the <i>Caroline</i> had abducted one of the most
beautiful American girls I have ever seen. He tried to
force her to marry him, but she stood out against his
threats, saying she would kill herself rather than be his
wife."</p>

<p>"Brave girl!"</p>

<p>"Her abductor was killed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good thing, for if he had been alive I would have
strung him up to the yardarm."</p>

<p>Naval commanders had the power to execute any
criminal, and they often took advantage of that, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
did of another power vested in them&mdash;that of marrying.
On the high seas a marriage ceremony performed by a
captain, and duly entered on the ship's log, is as legal as
if the presiding official was a clergyman or judge.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was killed in the engagement, but his prisoner
is here. She loves most earnestly one of my officers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Decatur laughed.</p>

<p>"You sly dog," he said. "I see; you want me to marry
you. Ah, well, if she is worthy&mdash;but that is your lookout.
It is your risk."</p>

<p>"You do not understand me, captain."</p>

<p>"Don't I? Well, speak up and tell me what you mean."</p>

<p>"Do you remember John Tempest? The man who
blighted his career in our navy by expressing sympathy
with James Vincent?"</p>

<p>"Vincent Decatur, you mean. My nephew, sir, as brave
a man as ever walked, and brother of a girl&mdash;why, bless
me, sir, that girl would charm the heart of an anchorite.
She is the dearest, sweetest little doll that ever
walked&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A ship's deck, uncle."</p>

<p>Bertha had heard her uncle's voice, and could not be
restrained.</p>

<p>She had crept quietly up the companionway, and when
she heard herself so warmly praised she was unable to
resist longer.</p>

<p>"Bertha! Zounds! Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"The cabin, uncle. I did not know my worth until
you rehearsed it; then I could not resist. So, you dear
old nunkey, you've come to see me. I made him send.
You'll not be cross with him&mdash;now will you?"</p>

<p>"Were you the prisoner this gentleman spoke about?"</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle, and if it had not been for the <i>Lively Bee</i>,
of which Mr. Vernon is captain, I should have been dead
before this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"And so you want to marry him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, please, uncle."</p>

<p>"So you shall. Join hands&mdash;&mdash; What's the matter
with you, sir?"</p>

<p>Vernon had stepped back, and the captain was at a loss
to understand his meaning.</p>

<p>"I am not the happy man."</p>

<p>"Zounds! didn't you hear Bertha, my niece, say she
wanted to marry you? And, by Jove! she shall have her
way, or I'm not a captain in the United States navy."</p>

<p>Bertha scarcely understood what it all meant, but laying
her hand on her uncle's arm, said:</p>

<p>"We do not want to marry until we reach land."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense! I can tie you as tightly as any
landlubber. Join hands, I say."</p>

<p>"I'll send for him, uncle, and see what he says."</p>

<p>"Send for him! Can't you see him standing there?"</p>

<p>"No, uncle, John is below."</p>

<p>"Who is John?"</p>

<p>"I am, sir. John Tempest, first lieutenant of the <i>Lively
Bee</i>, and at present commanding officer of the <i>Caroline</i>."</p>

<p>Captain Decatur did not speak.</p>

<p>"I sent the message to you. It was on Bertha's account;
I thought you might wish her to go back with
you."</p>

<p>"So you are here, John Tempest, are you? Well, well,
my dignity says I ought not to recognize you, but my
manhood says you're a brick, John Tempest, and if Bertha
wants you, why, let her take you, and I'll give you my
blessing."</p>

<p>"But, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Join hands, I say, and I'll make you one. It is the
law, sir. I am the holder of Uncle Sam's commission,
and I can marry you as tightly as any one. Join hands,
I say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Bertha put out her hand toward Tempest.</p>

<p>What could he do but accept it?</p>

<p>No sooner were the two hands joined than Captain
Decatur commenced:</p>

<p>"I call you all to witness that this man&mdash;what's your
name, sir?&mdash;ah, yes, John Tempest, takes this woman&mdash;it
is better than saying lady, my dear&mdash;Bertha Decatur,
to be his wife. Now therefore I, being the lawful commander
of the naval ship <i>United States</i>, do declare them
to be legally married. And may the Lord have mercy on
their souls!&mdash;I mean, may the Lord bless them;" and
Decatur kissed the bride.</p>

<p>"Where is your log, sir?" asked Tempest. "I have
only the one on the <i>Lively Bee</i>; the log of the <i>Caroline</i>
is British."</p>

<p>"Dear me, that's a pretty how d'ye do! I married you
on a British ship, where I have no jurisdiction."</p>

<p>"No, Captain Decatur. The <i>Caroline</i> has been renamed
the <i>Bertha</i>, and two days ago the alteration was
made in the log."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it. But I'd like you to come over to my

I insist."</p>

<p>"If you really insist, uncle, I shall appeal to my husband."</p>

<p>"Come, the boat is ready, and I want you tied so tight
to this fellow that he cannot run away if he wanted to."</p>

<p>To humor the captain, Tempest and Bertha were taken
on board the <i>United States</i>, where they were again married
according to the laws governing the navy.</p>

<p>December was within three days of its close, and the
people of Washington had chosen the night of the twenty-eighth
for a grand ball and reception to the naval officers,
whose victories had made their names historic.</p>

<p>Specially was Captain Stewart of the <i>Constellation</i> to
be honored.</p>

<p>A brilliant company was gathered, and the White
House never looked more lovely.</p>

<p>"Dolly" Madison was the mistress of the executive
mansion, and we have all heard our fathers say how
beautiful she was, and how charming as an entertainer.</p>

<p>Captain Hull of the victorious <i>Constitution</i> was present,
and to add to the <i>éclat</i> of the occasion the captured colors
of the <i>Alert</i> and <i>Guerriere</i> were draped on the wall.</p>

<p>Then there was a representation of the <i>Constitution</i>,
rudely drawn, 'tis true, but it served the purpose.</p>

<p>Beneath it were the words:</p>

<p>"A bunch of pine boards, under a strip of striped
bunting."</p>

<p>It wanted only a few minutes of midnight. The revelry
was at its height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>A more brilliant scene could not be imagined.</p>

<p>The elegant toilets of the ladies, the gorgeous uniforms
of the representatives of the army and navy, the bright
court dresses of the diplomatic corps, looked dazzlingly
beautiful beneath the light of a thousand wax candles
held by multitudinous sconces.</p>

<p>An old-fashioned minuet was being danced, when a
murmur passed through the room.</p>

<p>How it originated no one could have told, but all seemed
to know that news of another victory had been brought.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Navy left the room, and in a few
minutes re-entered, accompanied by two officers wearing
lieutenants' uniforms.</p>

<p>Men clapped their hands, women waved their handkerchiefs,
and the scene was changed from one of terpsichorean
pleasure to that of patriotic delight.</p>

<p>Then one of the lieutenants handed a document to the
Secretary of the Navy, who read it in silence.</p>

<p>His face wore an expression of pleasure as he finished,
and turning to the people he said in a voice husky with
patriotic emotion:</p>

<p>"I have the proud privilege of introducing Lieutenant
Hamilton of the good ship <i>United States</i>, who will tell
you of an engagement on Christmas Day whereby the
English lost their warship <i>Macedonian</i>, forty-nine guns."</p>

<p>If the cabinet officer had intended saying anything more,
he was doomed to disappointment, for the people's cheers
drowned all utterance.</p>

<p>When silence had been obtained, the secretary led another
lieutenant forward.</p>

<p>"This, ladies and gentlemen, is Lieutenant Tempest, of
the <i>Lively Bee</i>, privateer. He has to tell of the sinking
of his Britannic majesty's ship <i>Monarch</i>, and the capture
of the armed merchantman, the <i>Caroline</i>."</p>

<p>Again the cheers resounded, and Tempest saw himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
reflected in the mirrors as the recipient of a glorious
ovation.</p>

<p>But when it was known that the two heroes had brought
with them the colors of the captured vessels, the enthusiasm
exceeded everything imaginable.</p>

<p>Captains Hull and Stewart were commissioned by the
President to bring in the captured trophies.</p>

<p>When they re-entered the hall, Captain Hull and Lieutenant
Hamilton carried the flag taken from the <i>Macedonian</i>,
while Captain Stewart and Tempest performed
the same act with the <i>Monarch's</i> colors.</p>

<p>Amid the plaudits of the people the flags were laid before
Mrs. Madison, who allowed the young officers to kiss
her hand.</p>

<p>The order was given to proceed to the banquet hall,
and the people were moving that way when Dolly Madison,
catching sight of two boys waiting outside, asked
who they were.</p>

<p>"Jack Creamer of the <i>United States</i>, and Bob of the
<i>Lively Bee</i>. It was Bob, Mrs. Madison, who captured the
colors of the <i>Monarch</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that really true?"</p>

<p>The incident was told by Tempest, and when the guests
had taken their seats Mrs. Madison made room on her
right hand for Bob, the powder-monkey.</p>

<p>"The health of Commodore Decatur and the officers and
crew of the <i>United States</i>," proposed the toastmaster, and
our friend Bob, who thought the <i>Lively Bee</i> should have
taken precedence, added in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"And don't forget the <i>Lively Bee</i>, privateer."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MARRIAGE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.</p>


<p>One can easily imagine the consternation in that brilliant
assembly when Bob, the powder-monkey of the
privateer, took upon himself the duties of toastmaster,
and asked that distinguished gathering of banqueters to
drink to the officers and crew of the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>The diplomatic corps looked aghast.</p>

<p>There wasn't one of the nations they represented but
would employ privateers if at war, but they would not
just then acknowledge it.</p>

<p>As one quaint old sea dog put it.</p>

<p>"A privateer is a man who does all the dirty work in a
naval war, receives all the kicks, and watches others enjoy
the glories."</p>

<p>So, while all nations employed privateers, they never
recognized the officers and crews as being other than patriotic
pirates.</p>

<p>The gathering was, however, full of enthusiasm, and
Dolly Madison herself led the drinking of the toast.</p>

<p>Secretary of the Navy, Paul Hamilton, responded for
the government, and complimented the <i>Lively Bee</i> on attacking
and capturing a war vessel.</p>

<p>"That was a brave act, and even though she sailed under
a letter of marque, we must acknowledge that she did
the State great service."</p>

<p>Then Lieutenant Tempest acknowledged the toast,
while Lieutenant Hamilton merely bowed.</p>

<p>Bob was close to Mrs. Madison, and was particularly
pleased with himself.</p>

<p>He heard the President's wife say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a handsome man that young privateer is!"</p>

<p>Bob leaned over the lady's shoulder and whispered:</p>

<p>"But you should see his wife; she's a stunner&mdash;A1 anywhere;
she is a beauty!"</p>

<p>A young lady, who had not long made her <i>début</i>, and
had been looking at Tempest with eyes which were full
of love, now blushed slightly and in a low whisper said:</p>

<p>"What a pity he is married; he is so very handsome."</p>

<p>Bob might have heard what was said, but he took no
notice except to remark to Mrs. Madison that the lieutenant
captured his bride at the same time he did the
vessel.</p>

<p>Seeing that the two boys were drinking rather freely,
and getting far more talkative, their officers ordered them
from the room, much to Bob's annoyance. Jack Creamer
took it good-naturedly, and when he and Bob found such
good things in store for them in the kitchen, they began
to feel more thoroughly at home.</p>

<p>During the evening Dolly managed to ask Tempest
about his wife.</p>

<p>"You have heard?" he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Ah! you little think how such news travels," she answered
teasingly.</p>

<p>"Surely, the commodore did not tell you?"</p>

<p>"Is it a secret, then?"</p>

<p>"No, dear madam; but the circumstances were so
strange that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would like to know all about it," interjected the mistress
of the White House, who loved to hear a love romance
quite as much as she did when wooed and won as
a wife.</p>

<p>Tempest needed no pressing, for he was in love with
Bertha, and nothing was so gratifying to him as to talk
of her.</p>

<p>He told his story, and Mrs. Madison was delighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Her eyes flashed with the fire of youth, her face flushed
with pleasure, and she had to call her husband to tell
him of the brave privateer's love story.</p>

<p>President Madison listened.</p>

<p>"Decatur's niece the wife of a privateer! Sir, what
magic did you use?"</p>

<p>The President spoke as though he were angry, but a
smile flitted over his face as his wife answered him:</p>

<p>"The same magic you used, James, when you said you
loved me."</p>

<p>"Well, well! and so Decatur acted as celebrant! Are
you thinking of having the ceremony performed in Washington?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;had not thought&mdash;but it would be as well."</p>

<p>Tempest hesitated and stammered.</p>

<p>A new complexion was put upon his marriage.</p>

<p>He knew Decatur had the right to perform the ceremony,
but there were some who would doubt.</p>

<p>Dorothea Madison saw his perplexity.</p>

<p>"Of course, and the wedding shall be from the White
House. Oh, yes, I insist, James, and do not say no, for
I am mistress of the White House, you know."</p>

<p>"My dear Dolly, I am not objecting, but what will the
world say about a privateer being married from the executive
mansion?"</p>

<p>"That the President of the United States dares to do
right, even though the world might frown," answered his
wife earnestly.</p>

<p>"My dear, you shall do as you please."</p>

<p>Then the sweet woman made a curtsey, and answered
with a pretty little pout:</p>

<p>"I know that, James, even though you are President
of the Republic."</p>

<p>The evening passed pleasantly, and the guests departed
long before midnight, happy in their patriotic love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>In those days night was not turned into day; the revels
ended at an early hour, for all believed in the good old
idea that an hour's beauty sleep before midnight was
worth two afterward.</p>

<p>On the following day John Tempest introduced his
wife to the White House circle, and Dorothea Madison
at once fell in love with Bertha.</p>

<p>The wedding was conducted on a splendid scale; no
expense was spared, for Tempest was considered a naval
hero, and no one dared to even speak slightingly of the
privateer.</p>

<p>In fact, in the East Room of the White House the captured
flags were draped on the wall, and underneath were
the names of the victorious vessels:</p>

<p>The <i>Wasp</i>, <i>Constitution</i>, <i>United States</i> and <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>The President took no part in the exercises, but was
present.</p>

<p>The clergyman who performed the ceremony explained
that John Tempest and Bertha Decatur had been legally
married at sea by the gallant commander of the man-of-war
<i>United States</i>, but the contracting parties desired the
blessing of the Church upon their union.</p>

<p>So, on New Year's Day, in the eventful year Eighteen
hundred and thirteen, John Tempest was again married
to the object of his choice, and this time not on the high
seas, but with all the grandeur and <i>éclat</i> of marriage in
the residence of the chief magistrate of a great nation.</p>

<p>The sun shone brightly as the bride and groom left
the house and walked across the park.</p>

<p>"It is an omen," said Tempest.</p>

<p>"Yes, the sun shines on us, and may it shine on our
country's cause."</p>

<p>"Amen!"</p>

<p>Even as he made the response he trembled, for in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
few days he was to part with his wife and rejoin the
<i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>He dreaded that moment, not because he was afraid,
but he had formed a sweet binding tie, and he disliked
breaking that tie, even to obey his country's call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE.</p>


<p>"To-morrow, Bertha, I must leave the city to rejoin
the <i>Lively Bee</i>," said Tempest to his bride, on the evening
of the fifth day of January.</p>

<p>"Alas! that it should be so," responded Bertha.</p>

<p>"You would not wish me to neglect my duty?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, a thousand times, no. I have loved you
because you were so true. Your country is your first
love, and were you false to your flag I should even doubt
your love for me." She had spoken bravely, but her heart
was full of grief.</p>

<p>She knew too well what dangers he would have to encounter,
and the <i>Lively Bee</i>, though almost invincible,
was so small to grapple with such an enemy as the British.</p>

<p>While yet they talked, Lieutenant Hamilton of the
<i>United States</i>, with face all beaming, interrupted their
tearful talk.</p>

<p>"I have sold the prizes. Everything is adjusted," he
said.</p>

<p>"That is good news."</p>

<p>"Indeed it is, for I must rejoin at once and you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shall journey with you."</p>

<p>"That is good news, though I am sorry you have to
leave your young wife."</p>

<p>And the young naval officer bowed most courteously
to Bertha Tempest.</p>

<p>"I would not wish my husband to fail in his duty," she
answered, blushing as she mentioned the word "husband,"
it sounded so new and strange to her.</p>

<p>"Bertha will be in good hands," said Tempest. "She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
has made such lots of friends, and Mrs. Madison declares
she will have her as a frequent visitor at the White
House."</p>

<p>"I am very glad."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>The words were not spoken by either of the three.</p>

<p>It was a new voice which chimed in, and one that all
three easily recognized, for no one could be deceived who
had ever heard Harry Vernon of the <i>Lively Bee</i> speak.</p>

<p>But how came he in Washington?</p>

<p>What new business had brought him there?</p>

<p>He must have followed quickly on their heels, for traveling
was slow work in those days.</p>

<p>"Well, Hamilton, how have you succeeded?"</p>

<p>"Well, passing well; that cargo of the <i>Caroline</i> was a
rich one."</p>

<p>"I know it. The manifests proved its worth. What
did you get for ship and cargo?"</p>

<p>"Guess."</p>

<p>"I know its worth. A quarter of a million would not
build and equip a better vessel than the <i>Caroline</i> and stock
her with such a cargo."</p>

<p>"You are right, but of course you could not expect full
value."</p>

<p>"No, I do not."</p>

<p>"I obtained two hundred thousand dollars and another
four thousand from the government for the <i>Monarch's</i>
guns and ammunition."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"You have not heard all."</p>

<p>"What other news in store?"</p>

<p>"You are offered the command of the <i>Caroline</i>."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you, Harry Vernon, of the <i>Lively Bee</i>, privateer."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"The purchasers intend fitting the <i>Caroline</i> up as a
privateer, carrying four or six long guns, and you are offered
the command."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, not all the wealth of the Indies could
purchase my consent."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Caroline</i> is a fine boat. She would make a good
war ship, but she has not the lines of a privateer. It
would be impossible to fly from pursuers, or even to pursue.
No, no, the <i>Lively Bee</i> is my home."</p>

<p>"I told the factor as much, and I was then commissioned
to offer the command to Mr. Tempest. What say
you, sir?"</p>

<p>"That I am flattered, Hamilton, but I am lieutenant of
the <i>Lively Bee</i>, and for this war I shall tread her deck."</p>

<p>"Bravo, Tempest! But what do you think brought me
here?"</p>

<p>"We have wondered, but our wonderment could not be
satisfied."</p>

<p>"Then wonder no longer. I received some news. I
have just paid my respects to the President and his lady.
I heard what a furore you created there, Mistress
Tempest."</p>

<p>"But the news?"</p>

<p>"Was brought to land by an old friend and chum of
mine. He was taken sick with ague as soon as he landed.
The news was so very urgent that I accepted the mission,
and here I am."</p>

<p>"But the news?"</p>

<p>"Has electrified the President and his Cabinet. But
I am hungry. Join me at the dining table, and afterward
I will a tale unfold, as the story-books say, and make your
hair stand on end, as you hear of the glorious victory."</p>

<p>"Victory?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, man. The <i>Constitution</i> has won a glorious victory,
capturing the British frigate <i>Java</i> off San Salvador."</p>

<p>"When was that?"</p>

<p>"On the twenty-ninth of December," answered Vernon,
"just after the <i>Lively Bee</i> ran down the <i>Gamecock</i>."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Tempest, his eyes filled
with wonder.</p>

<p>"Do you think the <i>Lively Bee</i> could remain idle while
you were enjoying yourselves? No, sir. We started off
on a coasting cruise, hoping to find some West Indiaman
bound to or from San Salvador."</p>

<p>"And you did?"</p>

<p>"It was not much, nothing worth talking about. It
happened on the twenty-eighth that we sighted a nice,
trim little schooner laden with sugar.</p>

<p>"We naturally ordered it to 'lay to,' but the saucy Britisher
treated us contemptuously and hoisted her sails to
outsail us. The <i>Lively Bee</i> can fly with the wind, and so
the saucy <i>Gamecock</i> did not gain very much.</p>

<p>"Scarron asked permission to fire our long gun, and,
of course, I granted it. He did not appear to take proper
aim; but he had charge of the gun, not I. To my astonishment
the shot went tearing across the deck of the
<i>Gamecock</i>, splintering her mainmast and killing the first
officer.</p>

<p>"Its name would lead you to expect a great fight, but
at the very first shot down came the flag, and the <i>Gamecock</i>
became ours.</p>

<p>"It was but a small prize, but one quickly sold, for the
very day I reached land I sold vessel and cargo for thirty-eight
thousand."</p>

<p>"Do you call that a small matter?"</p>

<p>"Of course, the <i>Lively Bee</i> likes to run into the hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
of thousands. But come, let us dine, and then the
story of the <i>Constitution</i>."</p>

<p>Tempest was glad to see his friend; and more so, perhaps,
because his departure would be delayed a few days.</p>

<p>Bertha did show her appreciation by pinching her husband's
arm, a sure indication that she was pleased.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Captain Harry Vernon sang the above lines as a sort
of introduction to his story.</p>

<p>He felt particularly elated.</p>

<p>Jack either is boisterously happy, when on land, or else
excessively melancholy.</p>

<p>Harry Vernon was very jolly&mdash;no other word aptly describes
his state of mind.</p>

<p>Perhaps the generous dinner of which he had just partaken,
or it may be the fact that he was the bearer of
such good news, affected him; whatever the cause, the
fact was unaltered, he was lively and merry, and sang the
song with the fervor of a man before the mast.</p>

<p>"You will remember," commenced Vernon, "that Captain
Hull resigned his command of the <i>Constitution</i> in
order that some other officer might win laurels with the
noble frigate.</p>

<p>"In his place, Bainbridge was appointed, and of course
you know, Tempest, that there is not a better or braver
man in the entire navy than that same Bainbridge."</p>

<p>"I have heard of his gallant conduct in the wars against
France and Tripoli," answered Hamilton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was the <i>Hornet</i> with the <i>Constitution</i> when the fight
took place?" asked Tempest, almost impatiently.</p>

<p>"No. It appears not. The <i>Hornet</i> was blockading
the <i>Bonne Citoyenne</i>, but I must go back or you will not
understand.</p>

<p>"Fill up, men, and let one night at least be devoted to
patriotism and King Bacchus. Bertha&mdash;I beg pardon,
Mistress Tempest&mdash;will excuse you for one night," and
Vernon laughed heartily, as though he had perpetrated a
joke.</p>

<p>"The <i>Hornet</i> and <i>Constitution</i> were to cruise in company,
while Porter was to waylay West Indiamen, and
after a certain time proceed southward, calling at several
South American ports, with a view to join Bainbridge.</p>

<p>"When the two vessels reached the port of Praya in the
island of St. Jago, it became necessary to practice a little
deception.</p>

<p>"The two vessels floated the British flag, and the officers
took off every eagle button from their uniform.</p>

<p>"Then, with the greatest audacity, the officers next prepared
to land.</p>

<p>"They called on the governor, and paid their respects
to his family, and asked permission to leave letters for
Sir James Yeo, one of his Britannic majesty's naval commanders.</p>

<p>"The request was granted, and Bainbridge wrote the
letters.</p>

<p>"But what had they to do with an English captain?"
asked Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! They had to find an excuse for landing."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what you would say, but the fact remains,
they left the letters, and daring productions they were.</p>

<p>"But the best part of the whole thing was that, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Porter visited Praya, he would have called on the governor
and asked for letters for Yeo.</p>

<p>"Then Bainbridge's letters would be handed to him.
He would read them in the solitude of his own cabin, for
he knew that between the lines another letter was written
in sympathetic ink, and it was this letter which would
most interest him."</p>

<p>"But what if the governor knew Yeo?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"That Porter would have to find out, and should the
British captain be known, then Porter would take his cue
and be an ambassador from the gallant Sir James Yeo.</p>

<p>"It was a daring plan, but succeeded. Then the Americans
sailed away and reached San Salvador.</p>

<p>"As Brazil is at peace with us, there was no need for
deception, and Captain Lawrence of the <i>Hornet</i> was sent
in to see the American Consul.</p>

<p>"Lawrence returned greatly excited.</p>

<p>"In the harbor was the English ship <i>Bonne Citoyenne</i>,
of twenty guns, and just about to sail for England.</p>

<p>"The <i>Hornet</i> carries eighteen guns, so what did Lawrence
do but send an officer to the <i>Bonne Citoyenne</i>, with
a formal challenge to the captain to come out of the harbor
and try conclusions with the <i>Hornet</i>.</p>

<p>"Every assurance was given that the <i>Constitution</i> would
lay in the offing, and take no part in the fight.</p>

<p>"The English captain answered the challenge most
courteously, but declined to accept it."</p>

<p>"What reason did he give?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"Of course he was afraid," exclaimed Hamilton.</p>

<p>"But would never acknowledge it."</p>

<p>"No, but I suppose he pleaded that it might compromise
Brazil."</p>

<p>"You are both wrong," answered Vernon. "He said
he had on board five hundred pounds sterling, which he
was conveying to England, and that to meet the <i>Hornet</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
would be unwise, as it would place the money in jeopardy."</p>

<p>"Don't you wish the <i>Lively Bee</i> was on the <i>Bonne Citoyenne's</i>
track?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"Yes, but what could the <i>Bee</i> do against twenty guns?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Lively Bee</i> would find a way to sting."</p>

<p>"I am glad you have such a strong faith in the <i>Bee</i>,
but to proceed with my story: The <i>Hornet</i>, when it found
the <i>Bonne Citoyenne</i> would not fight, remained outside
the harbor, as a blockader, while the <i>Constitution</i> continued
to cruise alone.</p>

<p>"Three days only elapsed before she sighted two vessels,
well into the shore.</p>

<p>"Bainbridge's heart beat with hope.</p>

<p>"His great chance had come, for he felt sure that the
two vessels were British war ships.</p>

<p>"One of them seemed to make for the shore, while the
other made her course boldly for the <i>Constitution</i>.</p>

<p>"Bainbridge now clearly saw that the approaching vessel
was a man-of-war of formidable build.</p>

<p>"The crew of the American ship waited orders.</p>

<p>"They were all anxiety, for they dearly loved a fight.</p>

<p>"To their horror and disgust, their captain ordered the
vessel put to sea.</p>

<p>"Murmurings were heard, but Bainbridge laughed
quietly to himself, for he saw clearly the coastline, dark
and low, of Brazil, and he knew that the Englishman
could easily retreat into neutral waters if pressed too
hard.</p>

<p>"So he made all sail, as though in flight.</p>

<p>"The Englishman so understood it, and crowded on
sail in pursuit.</p>

<p>"By noon the two ships were near enough for their flags
to be visible.</p>

<p>"'Run up the ensign!' ordered Bainbridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"The colors were set, and answered by the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Bainbridge continued his retreat for another hour.</p>

<p>"Fast and yet faster flew the British war ship.</p>

<p>"It was something new for a Yankee to fly from an
Englishman, and the latter enjoyed it.</p>

<p>"Suddenly Bainbridge gave the order:</p>

<p>"'Take in the mainsails and royals.'</p>

<p>"The order was obeyed, though the crew wondered at
the reason for it.</p>

<p>"But when the <i>Constitution</i> tacked toward the enemy
a ringing cheer went up from the crew.</p>

<p>"Their captain was no coward.</p>

<p>"The coastline of Brazil was below the horizon, and
Bainbridge was confident he could prevent the enemy retreating.</p>

<p>"The drum beat to quarters, and quietly the veterans
got to work to meet the foe.</p>

<p>"The <i>Java</i>, for such the enemy proved to be, hauled
down her colors, leaving only a jack flying.</p>

<p>"This action puzzled Bainbridge, who ordered a shot
to be fired, which should mean that the ensigns be raised
again.</p>

<p>"This challenge was answered by a broadside.</p>

<p>"The battle was now on in dead earnest. The <i>Java</i>
was the better sailer, and both ships were well manned.</p>

<p>"The firing was rapid, the aim good.</p>

<p>"It looked bad for the American, after an hour's fighting,
for a round shot carried away her wheel, and the captain
was wounded by a small copper bolt, which was
driven into his thigh.</p>

<p>"For a few minutes it looked as though our boat was
lost, for she would not answer to the rudder, her head
fell off, and her sails flapped idly against the spars.</p>

<p>"Though suffering excruciating agony, Bainbridge directed
every movement. Tackle was rigged upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
rudder-post between decks, and a crew of jackies worked
the improvised helm.</p>

<p>"Then a new difficulty arose. The helmsmen were out
of earshot of the quarterdeck.</p>

<p>"A young middy suggested the remedy, and a line of
middies was formed from the quarterdeck to the sailors
who were tugging at the steering apparatus."</p>

<p>"Bravo, Bainbridge!" shouted Hamilton.</p>

<p>"I would like to have been there," added Tempest.</p>

<p>"So would I," assented Harry Vernon. "It makes a
man's blood run quicker when he hears of such things,
and I can scarcely have patience to tell of the glorious
deeds, I am so warm and excited.</p>

<p>"The gunners had not been idle; they kept continuously
firing, and the <i>Java's</i> jibboom and bowsprit were so shattered
that, when the ships met, the mizzen-mast fell,
crashing through forecastle and main deck, and killing
several of the officers."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Vernon, but you say, 'when the ships
met.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, the Englishman, seeing that the Yankee was getting
the best of the fight, despite her crippled condition,
determined to close and board. It was a mad thing to
do, but English sailors are always daring.</p>

<p>"The ships met and lay yardarm to yardarm.</p>

<p>"The men could not see each other, for a dense sulphurous
smoke hid the two vessels. It was only at rare
intervals that the cloud of powder smoke arose, and then
the faces of the gunners showed how determined they
were.</p>

<p>"When the British made ready to board the Yankee a
new surprise awaited them.</p>

<p>"In the <i>Constitution's</i> tops were two small howitzers,
and suddenly the topmen began to pour into the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the would-be boarders a perfect shower of grape and canister.</p>

<p>"A daring young middy in the tops seized a musket and
aimed at the <i>Java's</i> captain.</p>

<p>"The brave officer fell to the deck dead, but Lieutenant
Chads, although badly wounded, continued the fight, and
every British tar seemed to fight with greater determination.</p>

<p>"The fight continued until the <i>Java</i> was a helpless
wreck.</p>

<p>"Her flag was shot away, and only the Jack remained.
This was hauled down, and the <i>Java</i> was added to the
rich prizes of the war."</p>

<p>"I don't know much about the <i>Java</i>," said Hamilton.</p>

<p>"She is new to me, and I thought I was pretty well
posted about the enemy," Tempest added.</p>

<p>"I never heard her name before," continued Vernon,
"but I learned that she had just been fitted up for the accommodation
of the governor-general of Bombay and his
staff, all of whom were on board."</p>

<p>"And they are prisoners?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"They are."</p>

<p>"What a ransom they would have had to pay the <i>Lively
Bee</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Vernon; "they are better off on the
<i>Constitution</i>."</p>

<p>"You have brought great, good news."</p>

<p>"Indeed I have."</p>

<p>"What became of the <i>Java</i>?"</p>

<p>"She was fired, and only bits of charred wreckage remain
of one of the best English frigates."</p>

<p>"What did Scarron think?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"Scarron was like a wild Indian. He danced and
shouted, and when that did not satisfy him, he started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
singing 'Yankee Doodle,' but finally got on to his favorite
chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i13">"'Charge the can cheerily,<br /></span>
<span class="i13">Send it round merrily;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's to our country and captains commanding;<br /></span>
<span class="i13">To all who inherit<br /></span>
<span class="i13">Of Bainbridge the spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disdaining to strike while a stick is left standing.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"That Scarron must be quite a poet, or <i>pote</i>, as Bob
calls him," said Hamilton, "for Bob is always singing,
and when I ask him where he learned the words, he always
answers in the one word 'Scarron.'"</p>

<p>"Did he tell you the verse Scarron declares the men on
the <i>Guerriere</i> sang when going into action?"</p>

<p>"No; what was it?"</p>

<p>"You remember the words, Tempest, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I think so," answered Tempest; "they ran something
after this fashion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Brave Dacres waved his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cried: "Now, lads, aboard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll soon stop their singing,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yankee Doodle Dandy, O!"'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yes, those were the words, and I remember Scarron
singing a song giving our side of the story:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Ye tars of our country, who seek on the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause for the wrongs your country sustain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoice and be merry, for bragging John Bull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has got a sound drubbing from brave Captain Hull.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The evening was far advanced before our friends
thought of parting.</p>

<p>Tempest was the first to rise; he had not forgotten that
his bride was alone.</p>

<p>Hamilton and Vernon had another bottle of wine, and
were swearing eternal friendship when a constable, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
watchman, as he was then called, entered, and looking at
the two seamen, asked:</p>

<p>"Do either of you gentlemen know a sea dog called
Bob?"</p>

<p>"Bob! yes; what of him?"</p>

<p>"He is in trouble and wants to see you&mdash;not that you
can do him any good."</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Vernon.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, as to that, it is a hanging matter. He is likely
to die in a lofty position, 'twixt heaven and earth."</p>

<p>"What mean you, fellow?"</p>

<p>"Don't follow me; I am the watch."</p>

<p>"Are you? Then lead on, that I may see Bob, who at
least will talk sense."</p>

<p>"Poor young boy, he'll be hanged, oh, yes, he will, and
even your honors cannot save him."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A LESSON IN MILITARY LAW.</p>


<p>Even the charms of Bertha Tempest's company did not
cause her husband to neglect his duty.</p>

<p>When he was told that Bob was in trouble, he at once
deemed it to be his duty and a privilege to go with Vernon
and see in what the boy's danger consisted.</p>

<p>Bob was one of nature's rough gems, and Tempest believed
there was a future for him which would repay
Scarron for his kindness in adopting the waif.</p>

<p>"Lead on!" commanded Vernon, as the watchman
seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the hope of receiving something a little
warmer than the cold air of the night which made the officer
of the law linger over the blazing logs of wood on
the massive andirons.</p>

<p>But Vernon, though he liked the fire's warmth as much
as did the watchman, was eager to find Bob.</p>

<p>"Lead on. I must see the powder-monkey without
delay."</p>

<p>"Powder-monkey! ha, ha, ha, that's good, it just suits.
Eh?"</p>

<p>"What were you saying?" asked Vernon.</p>

<p>"Nothing, your honor."</p>

<p>"But you laughed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, your honor, I laughed&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;but at my
thoughts."</p>

<p>"If your thoughts were so interesting I would like to
laugh with you."</p>

<p>Vernon was in an unusually pleasant humor; perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the genial influence of the wine and the sharpness of the
winter air combined made him feel bright and cheerful.</p>

<p>"Come now, your thoughts, watchman; what were they
like?" added Tempest.</p>

<p>"But your honor may be thinking I'm presuming&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no. Come, let us hear them."</p>

<p>"Well, your honor did call that harum-scarum boy,
whose neck is likely to be lengthened, unless the good
Lord forbid, a powder-monkey&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! So he is a powder-monkey," laughed
Vernon, "and I have several more of them on my ship."</p>

<p>"Audacious monkeys!" said the watchman.</p>

<p>"No, powder-monkeys. Perhaps you do not understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, sir. I'd like to remember that name, and
have a laugh at it many a time."</p>

<p>It was no use trying to explain to the watchman, so
Vernon desisted and walked along by the side of the officer,
threading the streets, which were but sparsely built
up in those days, to the place where Bob was confined.</p>

<p>The lockup was near the Potomac, and not far from
the then new navy yard.</p>

<p>Bob was so great a criminal in the eyes of the watchman
that, to prevent his escape, he had been placed in the
stocks.</p>

<p>He was seated on a hard bench, his ankles fastened securely
through holes in a movable board in front of him.</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to stand up, and as his seat
was loose, if he wriggled about much the bench would
be overturned, and he would fall on his back, with his
feet, still imprisoned, above his head.</p>

<p>"Bob, what means this?" asked Vernon.</p>

<p>"I'm glad your honor came; but, sir, the watch tells
me I'm to be hanged at daybreak. Not that I minds
death&mdash;a powder-monkey ought not to be afeared&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
I'd like to meet it on the deck of the <i>Lively Bee</i>, sir, and
I'd like an English bullet to take me off rather than
American rope."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about? What have you been
doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir. Nothing."</p>

<p>Now this was a strange thing. Here was a boy in the
stocks, told he was to die at daybreak, and yet declaring
that he was guiltless of all crime.</p>

<p>"But with what are you charged?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"Lor', your honor, they didn't charge me anything.
I'd have paid if they'd let me, but they said I must die."</p>

<p>"But you must have done something wrong."</p>

<p>"If I did I'm tarnation sorry, but I ain't sure I did
wrong."</p>

<p>"Tell us all."</p>

<p>"Well, your honor, I was expecting to leave the city
to-morrow with the captain"&mdash;meaning Tempest&mdash;"and I
kind o' thought that I'd see the big guns in the yard down
there, so as I could tell the boys and Mr. Scarron all about
them. So I went, and found the gates all locked; but I
climbed the wall and got over. Then, you know, I walked
about, looking at the guns, and I didn't see one as good
as ours. A man came up to me and looked at my face
for a long time before he spoke, and then he said: 'Who
are you?' and I said, 'Bob.' 'Bob what?' says he, and I
answered kind o' proud-like, 'No, I ain't Bob Watt; I'd
more likely be Bob Decatur, or Bob Porter, or Bob Vernon,
or Bob Hull,' I answered all in a breath, for I was
mad; I thought Watt was English, and I didn't want to
be thought anything but American. So he says, 'What's
your other name?' and I thought he meant again that my
name was Watt, so I swore, asking your honor's pardon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell your story shortly," interrupted Vernon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't a story, your honor, it's the truth, every word
of it."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"With that he struck at me, and I picked up a lanyard
and knocked him on the head. He said he'd have me
locked up, and I told him to do so, and if he did, Dolly
Madison would look after me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dolly Madison&mdash;who is that?"</p>

<p>"Lor', your honor, it's the lady as lives at the White
House&mdash;the President's wife&mdash;they all call her Dolly, and
she's a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"You should speak more respectfully of the first lady
in the land, Bob," Tempest remarked warmly.</p>

<p>"Now, Bob, that is all, is it?"</p>

<p>"No, your honor."</p>

<p>"What other crime did you commit?"</p>

<p>"The man asked me what I was doing there, and I told
him, and I said that the gun on the <i>Lively Bee</i> was better
than any they'd got. Then he showed how ignorant he
was, for he said as how the <i>Lively Bee</i> was English, or if
not, then she was only a private craft. With that I hit
him again with the lanyard&mdash;I'd been busy while I was
a-talking, and had put a good knot in the end, and, oh,
my, you should ha' seen him fall! He went kersplash
through a window and smashed it all to pieces. Then a
chap came out with a gun, and I asked him what the window
would cost, for I'd pay for it. He put up his gun,
and I said, 'Don't shoot, I'll pay for all the damage.' But
some more came running up, and I was tied up with a
rope, and brought here, and the chaps talked about treason
and murder, though I didn't know what it meant. And
that's all."</p>

<p>"Quite enough, too, Bob; I am afraid you are in Queer
Street."</p>

<p>"Is that the name of this street, your honor?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Bob. You've killed a man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that wrong, your honor?"</p>

<p>"Wrong? Why, it's murder!"</p>

<p>"But we killed a lot on the <i>Caroline</i> and the <i>Monarch</i>
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that was different, that was war."</p>

<p>"War? Well, and can't I kill a man as calls me a
pirate?"</p>

<p>"No, Bob, or you will get hanged for it. Then you
did wrong in going into the navy yard. That was
treason; you might have been an enemy."</p>

<p>"I don't understand all your fine lingo, your honor.
When I swam to the <i>Monarch</i> and climbed on deck and
brought away the flag, you said I was a hero, for you
wanted to know the size of the guns and all about the
<i>Monarch</i>; now, when I climb a wall to look at our own
guns&mdash;for they are American guns, aren't they?&mdash;then
I'm to die, for that's wrong."</p>

<p>It was hard to make Bob see the difference between
murder and lawful killing.</p>

<p>As the poet Young wrote a hundred and fifty years before,
Bob philosophized:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One to destroy is murder by the law;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gibbets keep the lifted hand in awe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To murder thousands, takes a specious name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War's glorious art, and gives immortal fame."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No wonder that the poor illiterate powder-monkey was
unable to see the difference in the degree of guilt.</p>

<p>"I will see what can be done, Bob, but I am afraid you
are in a bad fix."</p>

<p>"See Dolly&mdash;I ask pardon, Mrs. Madison&mdash;and she will
see to me."</p>

<p>"What can we do?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"I don't see my way clear. If I were on the deck of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
my own vessel I could adjudicate, but the laws on land
are so confoundedly strange," answered Vernon.</p>

<p>"But no murder was intended&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, but what right had Bob in the place at all?"</p>

<p>"A boyish trick."</p>

<p>"Granted, but he had no right to use force. What does
he mean by referring to Mrs. Madison?"</p>

<p>Tempest told him of the scene at the banquet, and
though the captain of the <i>Lively Bee</i> was feeling far from
cheerful, he was compelled to laugh at the comical adventures
of the powder-monkey at the White House.</p>

<p>"We must find out whether the man is alive or dead,"
said Vernon, as the story of Bob's danger was again
thought of.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"We must go to the navy yard."</p>

<p>"Will not the morning do?"</p>

<p>"No. Why delay? I am sure Mistress Tempest will
excuse you."</p>

<p>"I was not thinking of myself," answered Tempest;
"but shall we not appear overanxious?"</p>

<p>"Zounds, man! I'd drag the President from his bed
if I could save Bob."</p>

<p>And Tempest could well believe his captain capable of
doing so.</p>

<p>The two visited the navy yard, and the officer on duty
received them courteously.</p>

<p>He, however, declined to answer the question respecting
the man who had been struck by Bob.</p>

<p>"You see, it really makes no difference whether he is
alive or dead."</p>

<p>"It does, though."</p>

<p>"To the man and his family, yes, but to 'Bob' as you
call him, no."</p>

<p>"How do you reason that out?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>The man was evidently fond of talking, and crossed
his legs with an assumption of comfort as he spoke.</p>

<p>"We are at war, you admit that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Then, by the military code, for any one to enter an
arsenal or navy yard without permission is to incur the
fate of a spy. You know what that is?"</p>

<p>"Death."</p>

<p>"Just so; then Bob, climbing the wall and examining
our guns, is a spy, and therefore must die."</p>

<p>"But he is a good American, though an ignorant one."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"Then in that case it is a pity, but we must expect to
lose some good Americans in war times."</p>

<p>"But he is not a spy."</p>

<p>"Not now; no, he is in the stocks, but according to the
laws of war he was a spy."</p>

<p>"The court must decide that."</p>

<p>"Yes; but it will be after his death."</p>

<p>"After his death?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. He will die at sunrise."</p>

<p>"Explain yourself. Who has adjudged him worthy of
death?" asked Vernon earnestly.</p>

<p>"We are at war?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. This is admitted, or I should not have
been thanked by the President for the captures I have
made on the high seas."</p>

<p>Ignoring the latter part of Vernon's speech, the officer
continued:</p>

<p>"Then being at war, an assault on an officer while on
duty is an assault on the nation, and that is treason, and
the punishment of treason is death."</p>

<p>"But the courts&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>"May say Bob was innocent, and his family will have
that gratification, but he will be dead."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"We are at war&mdash;you are impatient&mdash;well, you admit
that. Now, the officer who was assaulted was a sentry;
an attack on a sentry during war time is an offense punishable
by death, and the colonel commanding orders it
within twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"Who is the officer in command?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"But you have not ordered Bob's execution?"</p>

<p>"No, fortunately my superior happened to be here at
the time. He gave the order, I shall carry it out."</p>

<p>"Where can he be found?"</p>

<p>"That I know not, for he left no word where he was
going; but he is not expected home until the morning."</p>

<p>"What is the use of our staying here?" asked Tempest,
<i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>The officer heard the question, however, and took it
upon himself to answer.</p>

<p>"Nothing, unless you like to sit by the fire and await
the execution."</p>

<p>"Zounds, man, what do you take us for?" asked Vernon,
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Most worthy gentlemen, who have had a most wholesome
lesson in military law."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BOB'S GOOD ANGEL.</p>


<p>Our friends walked away, thoroughly mad with the
officer, who had, however, only done his duty.</p>

<p>That Bob was condemned to death on such short notice
and poor evidence may appear strange to our readers, but
they must remember that the country was at war.</p>

<p>England had invaded the States, and had boldly declared
that Washington should be reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>The republic was only a few years old, and there were
many of the old tories who believed that England would
subjugate the new nation, and reduce it to a principality
or dependency of Britain.</p>

<p>These tories, while professedly loyal to the government,
were more the friends of England.</p>

<p>They loved the glare and glitter of a court, and yearned
for a native aristocracy. A king could confer titles, and
these superficial creatures felt that a title was something
worth having.</p>

<p>The government knew all this&mdash;knew that there was a
vast amount of veiled treason in Washington and all the
cities; and therefore in all the forts, arsenals and navy
yards military law prevailed.</p>

<p>Trivial offenses were treated as though they had taken
place before the enemy; the death penalty was meted out,
without compunction, for breaches of discipline which at
other times would have only received the punishment of
solitary confinement.</p>

<p>Harry Vernon knew that such law was maintained on a
man-of-war, but he could not understand why it should
be applied on land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>He was the more puzzled because Bob was handed over
to the civil authorities, and was placed in the city stocks.</p>

<p>"What shall you do next?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>The answer was given with such emphasis that Tempest
never forgot and never could forget it.</p>

<p>"Do? Go to Paul Hamilton, and if he does not release
Bob then I'll go to the President. If he refuses, dang me
if I don't bring the <i>Lively Bee</i> up the Potomac and fire
its guns until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! that is treason!"</p>

<p>"Call it what you like. If hanging is in order, why, let
them hang me; but I'll make them dance before they get
the chance."</p>

<p>Paul Hamilton was in bed.</p>

<p>He thought Vernon and Tempest some drunken roysterers,
and took no notice of their demand to see him.</p>

<p>The woman who answered the door of the secretary's
modest house was alarmed.</p>

<p>Well she might be, for the men both wore swords and
looked angry.</p>

<p>"Tell Secretary Hamilton that unless he comes down
we will force our way to his chamber and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sirs, he will see you, I am sure he will! please let me
go and ask him again."</p>

<p>"Go, my good girl, and hurry, for time is pressing."</p>

<p>The girl had not waited to hear the whole of the speech;
she had flown upstairs, and with sobs and tears had impressed
the secretary with the necessity for prompt action.</p>

<p>Dressed in a very unbecoming <i>déshabille</i>, consisting of
a long bathrobe, tied around the waist with a piece of red
bellcord, and old-fashioned nightcap on his head, and a
pair of slippers very much down at the heel, the popular
statesman and cabinet minister descended the stairs.</p>

<p>"Well, sirs, what affair of great moment made you
arouse me from my bed at this unseemly hour?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as a glimmer of light from the candle fell upon
Tempest's face, the secretary exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You are Lieutenant Tempest, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and this is Captain Vernon of the <i>Lively Bee</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah! the bearer of the news which hath so charmed us.
Forgive me for my <i>brusquerie</i>, but why call so late?"</p>

<p>Paul Hamilton was the very pink of gentlemanly courtesy,
and after overcoming his first outburst of anger at
being aroused from his warm bed, he was most cordial.</p>

<p>Tempest explained the object of his visit.</p>

<p>"There must be something wrong," he said; "if the boy,
as you say, is condemned to die, why is he not in the military
keeping?"</p>

<p>"That passes comprehension."</p>

<p>"Wait, gentlemen, until I dress, and I will see what
can be done."</p>

<p>The secretary was not long in making his appearance,
and went at once with Vernon and Tempest to the White
House.</p>

<p>"Only the President can stay an execution," he explained.</p>

<p>It was no pleasanter for a president to be aroused from
his slumbers than for an ordinary private citizen, and
James Madison obeyed the summons with some little reluctance.</p>

<p>An order was signed, granting a stay until further inquiry
could be made.</p>

<p>With this document our friends again went to the
lockup, and found Bob sleeping as peacefully as he could,
considering his unpleasant seat.</p>

<p>When told he was not to die quite as soon as he had
been led to anticipate, he evinced so much exuberant joy
that his bench fell over, and he sat down on the floor with
a force far from pleasant.</p>

<p>Knowing that Bob was in no further danger of losing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
his life, our friends returned to their hotel, but not before
learning that it was the commandant's daughter who had
been the cause of Bob's transmission to the civil authorities.</p>

<p>Miss Jones had thought the civil courts would not
allow the military execution, at least until after Bob had
been duly tried.</p>

<p>Her father, wishing to find an excuse for saving the
powder-monkey's life, had acceded to her request, and
thus given an opportunity for Bob's friends to raise a
point on constitutional law.</p>

<p>Early next morning our friends, accompanied this time
by Bertha Tempest, paid another visit to Bob.</p>

<p>To their delight he had been released from the stocks,
and was walking up and down the little room.</p>

<p>"Who released me?" he repeated in answer to an inquiry
made by his captain. "Oh, Lor', it was an angel
from heaven, no one else could be so beautiful, saving
Miss Bertha&mdash;I ask pardon, Mistress Tempest&mdash;and we all
know she is an angel."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," interrupted Vernon.</p>

<p>"Lor', sir, she came here an hour ago, and I was still
sitting like a trussed fowl, and she says, 'Let the poor boy
walk about a bit;' and the watchman says, 'To please you,
miss, I'd do anything, for your smile is like a streak of
sunshine on a cloudy day,' them's his words, and they
were true, too, and I says, 'My cap'n, miss, is the bravest
man as ever walked a deck, and if you want a good husband,
why he is the man you could love.'"</p>

<p>"For shame, Bob, insulting a lady like that."</p>

<p>"She wasn't insulted, for her face showed she was
pleased, it went so red, and she said as how she loved all
brave men, but did not want a husband."</p>

<p>"Who is she, do you know?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"Yes, she gave the watchman her name, quite proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
like, she says to him 'Let the poor boy,' that's me, cap'n,
'out of those stocks,' that's what they calls them things"&mdash;pointing
to the instrument of torture&mdash;"and she says, 'if
any one wants to know why you did it, tell them that Miss
Pauline Jones asked you.' But, cap'n, there she is&mdash;miss,
this is the brave cap'n I told you about."</p>

<p>Captain Vernon turned and saw the blushing face of
the commandant's daughter.</p>

<p>She knew that Bob's silly speech had been repeated to
Vernon, and her face flushed, making her look far more
beautiful, if that were possible.</p>

<p>She, however, possessed that easy grace which gave her
control over her feelings, and mutual interest in the powder-monkey
made her feel more at ease in talking with the
captain of the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>Bertha seemed to cotton to her at once, and before
many minutes were passed the two ladies felt that they
would be fast friends for life.</p>

<p>The man who had been assaulted by Bob did not die;
in fact, was scarcely injured, and as the powder-monkey
had said, Dolly Madison did intercede and secured the
young rascal's release.</p>

<p>Three days later Vernon, Tempest and Bob bade farewell
to Washington and hastened to rejoin the privateer.</p>

<p>Bertha had made many friends in the Capital City, and
though she found the parting from her husband hard to
bear, she knew she would be well cared for, and that loving
friends would try to cheer her in her solitude.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE REGINA, OF TORQUAY.</p>


<p>No one ever got a more royal welcome than did Bob,
the powder-monkey, on his return to the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>He was, in the eyes of the crew, a gallant hero.</p>

<p>Not only had he been rescued from death in a most
marvelous manner, but he had dined at the White House
and had been praised by the President's wife.</p>

<p>His stories of Washington were so colored that they
equaled those of the Arabian Nights or Baron Munchausen.</p>

<p>On the night after leaving port, Captain Vernon called
all the crew to the quarterdeck.</p>

<p>"Men, our prizes were rich ones. The prize money is
here and will be divided. I did not give it to you while in
port, for I know what temptations there are, and many
of you have wives and families who have a better claim
on you than the harpies who prey on Jackies at every port.
Have I done right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you always do right, cap'n," was the general response.</p>

<p>"But some of you have no wives, but only sweethearts,
and for their sakes I have kept back the money. Did I do
right?"</p>

<p>The single men were just as well pleased as had been
the married ones.</p>

<p>The crew had thought the prizes had not been sold, and
were perfectly content to wait.</p>

<p>Had the money been distributed while in port, the best
part of it would have disappeared and perhaps some of the
best men deserted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Not willfully, but Jack on shore is as innocent as a baby,
and soon loses his money.</p>

<p>Each man was surprised at the amount he had to receive,
for even Bob's share was equal to two hundred dollars,
while Mr. Scarron received four thousand.</p>

<p>The prize money is distributed according to rank, and
as Bob once told a friend:</p>

<p>"The more fighting you do, the less prize money; the
less hard work, the more money you get."</p>

<p>But they expected no exception to be made, and each
received more than was expected.</p>

<p>Each man counted his share and jingled the coins and
examined the bank notes with just as much interest as
would a child.</p>

<p>When that little matter was settled, and the men again
at their posts of duty, Tempest tapped the captain's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"What ails thee, Master Captain?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What eyes!" murmured Vernon; but as he suddenly
aroused from his reverie, he stammered like a schoolgirl.</p>

<p>Tempest could read the signs of the times, for he had
experienced all the bliss of young love.</p>

<p>"Whose eyes?" he asked, smiling as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Whose? As if there were any other eyes on earth. I
know you can sympathize with me, Tempest&mdash;I am in
love."</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>"Could I help it? Did you ever see any one in your
whole life more beautiful than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bertha," added Tempest softly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;Pauline!"</p>

<p>"She is pretty, and I have no doubt she is as good as her
face is lovely."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Tempest, for that. I don't want you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
think I disparage Bertha, for I have no wish; but when
compared to Pauline&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay, captain. Let us be just. To me, my wife is the
most beautiful, the most peerless woman on earth. To me
she is perfection. I know of nothing which could be compared
to her beauty, to the flash of her eye, to the sweetness
of her smile. But what she is to me, Pauline Jones
may be to you. Let us not make comparisons. We each
judge from our own standpoint."</p>

<p>"But you are prejudiced&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay, captain, I have not finished. If you thought of
my wife as I do&mdash;if she was to you the perfection of
heaven transferred to earth, you would hate me for being
her husband, for you would want her. If Pauline was to
me what you think her, I should hate you, for I should
wish to claim such beauty and perfection for myself. No,
no, old fellow! Our loves are all they should be. And I
pray Heaven to strike me dead that moment I first begin to
think any woman more beautiful or more perfect than my
Bertha."</p>

<p>"Sail, ho!"</p>

<p>That cry put a stop to all love talk.</p>

<p>From love-sick swains the officers were speedily transformed
into warriors.</p>

<p>"Where away?" asked Vernon.</p>

<p>"Due east."</p>

<p>"What ensign does she fly?"</p>

<p>"I cannot see. She is a schooner, and evidently armed."</p>

<p>"Bear down upon her, that we may know her value."</p>

<p>All was excitement and flurry.</p>

<p>The crew were anxious for a brush with the enemy, and
had come to think the <i>Lively Bee</i> invincible.</p>

<p>No United States war ship was near, and so the field
was open to the little privateer.</p>

<p>To the great disgust of the crew, however, the distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
craft flew the Stars and Stripes, and so, was not an
enemy.</p>

<p>For several days the <i>Lively Bee</i> flew over the water
without seeing the sail of an enemy's ship.</p>

<p>The men were getting weary and disheartened.</p>

<p>Amusements palled on them, and they were fast settling
into a state of chronic grumbling.</p>

<p>Then it was that the masthead shouted:</p>

<p>"Sail, ho!"</p>

<p>And the very words sent a thrill through the crew, for
they knew that unless there was a doubt about the nationality
of the vessel, no cry would have been raised.</p>

<p>"Where away?"</p>

<p>"South, southwest," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What is she like?"</p>

<p>"A schooner."</p>

<p>"Good, and her ensign?"</p>

<p>"She flies the English colors."</p>

<p>Vernon ordered the Union Jack of England to be run
up, and all appearances of war to be obliterated.</p>

<p>He gave orders to the helmsman to run the <i>Lively Bee</i>
close to the stranger.</p>

<p>When within gun range, Vernon fired a shot across the
Englishman's bow.</p>

<p>This was answered, and the stranger slackened sail.</p>

<p>The two vessels were now only a musket-shot away, and
Vernon saw that the stranger was the <i>Regina</i>, of Torquay.</p>

<p>"Whither bound?" asked Vernon through the speaking
trumpet.</p>

<p>"To Baltimore."</p>

<p>"What cargo?"</p>

<p>"Tin, and tinplates."</p>

<p>"Have you met with any Yankee men-of-war?"</p>

<p>"No. But two English ships are eastward ten degrees."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can we reach Jamaica without molestation?" asked
Vernon.</p>

<p>"Easily, if your ship can fly as she ought."</p>

<p>The vessels had now got within pistol-shot, and Vernon
could see that the <i>Regina</i> carried two guns.</p>

<p>He began to be suspicious.</p>

<p>Perhaps the ship was not a merchantman at all, but a
regularly equipped man-of-war, with a good fighting crew
below deck.</p>

<p>However, "faint heart never won fair lady," and Vernon
determined to take the initiative.</p>

<p>He gave his orders to Scarron, and instantly the English
flag was lowered, while the Stars and Stripes ran
proudly up the halliards.</p>

<p>But the change was noticed quickly by the <i>Regina</i>, and
almost as quick as a lightning flash, a large crew burst
upon the deck, armed with cutlasses and boarding irons.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HOW BOB KEPT HIS OATH.</p>


<p>All doubt had ended. The <i>Regina</i>, of Torquay, professedly
laden with tin, was as well armed as a war vessel,
and was either a British privateer or a man-of-war of the
second class.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Lively Bee</i> was not afraid of a hand-to-hand
encounter.</p>

<p>But with all his courage, he almost trembled when he
saw that he was outnumbered almost two to one.</p>

<p>He looked at his own men to see how they felt, and to
his great joy their faces were radiant with happiness.</p>

<p>The men were wishing for a fight, and saw a foe worthy
of their steel.</p>

<p>The two vessels were so close that a seaman could
easily jump from one to the other.</p>

<p>The <i>Regina</i> took the initiative, and commenced lashing
the two vessels together.</p>

<p>But though the Britons were eager to fight, the Americans
were equally so, and, headed by Vernon, the crew
of the <i>Lively Bee</i> leaped on the <i>Regina's</i> deck, much to the
surprise of the latter's crew.</p>

<p>The two vessels grated against each other, and as they
did so the British fired their pistols right in the faces of
the Americans.</p>

<p>Through the powder smoke the flash of steel could be
seen, and like Trojans the two crews fought.</p>

<p>The men cut and slashed with their cutlasses, and fired
off their pistols with deadly earnestness.</p>

<p>Marksmen posted in the tops of each vessel picked off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
men from the enemy's decks whenever an opportunity
offered.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Regina</i> saw his men driven back,
and sprang into the thickest of the fight to rally them.</p>

<p>As he did so it was seen that the blood was streaming
from a wound in his thigh.</p>

<p>While every one felt sympathy with the brave man, yet
that did not deter any from continuing the fight.</p>

<p>Harry Vernon sprang forward to meet his rival.</p>

<p>Their swords crossed, and the crews seemed to involuntarily
fall back, as though to give the men a chance to
fight a duel.</p>

<p>Vernon was in full vigor, and had not received a
scratch.</p>

<p>Blow was met by blow, and the two men fought as
though the whole issue of the war depended upon their
prowess.</p>

<p>Presently one of the topmen, thinking that Vernon was
in danger, fired, and a bullet crashed into the British captain's
brain.</p>

<p>But when the <i>Regina's</i> crew saw their captain fall they
fought more like demons than men.</p>

<p>The battle was one of the fiercest waged during the war.</p>

<p>The deck of the <i>Regina</i> looked like a slaughterhouse,
the dead bodies lay scattered in piles and singly.</p>

<p>Every officer of the British ship was killed, and one of
the crew, at last tired of the fight, took upon himself to
strike the flag.</p>

<p>His action was received with an uproarious shout of
joy, in which some of the British joined.</p>

<p>Both sides had suffered.</p>

<p>The British lost three-fourths of her crew, while the
<i>Lively Bee</i> mourned the loss of Mr. Webster, the wounding
of Scarron and four of the crew.</p>

<p>Poor Webster had fought like a giant, and several times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
his sword had been whetted with British blood before he
received his fatal wound.</p>

<p>Scarron was badly wounded in the right thigh, and the
surgeon of the <i>Regina</i> declared that nothing but amputation
could save his life.</p>

<p>Beyond a little surface wound in his arm, Vernon escaped,
while Tempest lost his little finger, which was shot
away early in the strife.</p>

<p>But very few thought of their wounds, for the prize was
a rich one.</p>

<p>The <i>Regina</i> had on its manifest an entry for a cargo
of tin plates.</p>

<p>Now, at that time, tin was a valuable commodity, and
the crew of the <i>Lively Bee</i> felt that their fortunes were
made.</p>

<p>It was impossible to transfer such a heavy cargo, and
so the <i>Regina</i> had to be towed back to port.</p>

<p>A small crew was placed in charge, commanded by
Tempest, and included the powder-monkey, our old friend
Bob.</p>

<p>As Bob would not go without Scarron, and that old
salt was in the hospital, otherwise the cockpit, of the
<i>Regina</i>, Captain Vernon with very good grace allowed the
powder-monkey to form part of the prize crew.</p>

<p>Among the prisoners was a West Indian, who had been
'pressed, and had been a very reluctant sailor.</p>

<p>He was a good seaman, an able pilot, and as clever a
navigator as any that sailed the seas.</p>

<p>In fact, he had at one time been master of a brig, but
grog had been his ruin, and he was reduced to the ranks,
and as man before the mast earned his living.</p>

<p>Luiga, for such was the name he chose to go by, more,
perhaps, because so few could pronounce it correctly, took
a great fancy to Bob, and told him such yarns of the
Southern seas as fairly turned his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"When this war is over, I shall turn pirate," said Bob,
"for I want to be rich."</p>

<p>In Bob's experience, which was all obtained second-hand
from yarns spun by the seamen, pirates were all
wealthy.</p>

<p>The prizes they captured were all rich ones, and the
dangers of a pirate's life were but few.</p>

<p>Luiga loved a wild life, and so stirred Bob's blood that
the two became, not only fast friends, but prospective
partners in a piratical cruise to be undertaken when the
war with England was at an end.</p>

<p>Every leisure hour of the day and night the two were
together, and Luiga gained such power over the powder-monkey
that he felt he could do as he liked with him.</p>

<p>"How are we to get a fast schooner?" asked Bob one
evening.</p>

<p>Luiga looked mysteriously wise as he whispered:</p>

<p>"Take the one that suits us best."</p>

<p>"But that would be stealing," suggested Bob, whereupon
Luiga winked his eye and laughed.</p>

<p>Bob's face turned crimson, for he was not yet quite so
hardened as to contemplate deliberate theft, though he
was prepared to devote his life to it as a pirate.</p>

<p>"I know a vessel which would just suit," suggested
Luiga.</p>

<p>"Do you? Where?"</p>

<p>"Can you keep a secret?"</p>

<p>"I swear I can."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you. This is the very boat."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. You stole it from the English; why not let
us steal it from the Americans? We would fight the
English until the war was over, and then the vessel would
be our own."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't understand," said Bob half-hesitatingly, for
he did not wish to be considered anything but smart.</p>

<p>Luiga proposed a grand scheme of mutiny.</p>

<p>The <i>Regina</i> could be easily seized, with its cargo, and
taken to the West Indies, where the tin could be disposed
of and the cruise of the piratical craft commenced.</p>

<p>Bob listened attentively, and really appeared to agree
to every particular.</p>

<p>"What is the tin worth?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Luiga. "Tin is valuable, but
there isn't so much of it."</p>

<p>"Not much?"</p>

<p>"No; there might be bullets underneath the tin."</p>

<p>And Luiga winked mysteriously.</p>

<p>"When could we seize the ship?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"The very first dark or foggy night. I have spoken
to four of the crew of the <i>Regina</i> and they have agreed
to join."</p>

<p>Tempest, with that generosity which characterized his
every action, had given the prisoners their freedom, and
they had made use of it to plan a mutiny.</p>

<p>As far as was known, Bob was the only American in
the secret.</p>

<p>Bob had sworn not to reveal the scheme, and he wanted
to keep his oath, but he was equally determined to frustrate
the mutineers, even if he had to forswear himself.</p>

<p>He could write a little, and made up his mind to reveal
the plot to Tempest in that way.</p>

<p>But when he thought of all he would be compelled to
write he grew despondent, for it would take too long.</p>

<p>Bob stole a piece of paper from the captain's desk, and
a pencil.</p>

<p>Writing was pretty hard work. He sat down at the
desk, and found it necessary to rest his head on his arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
so that his mouth would be on a line with the point of
the pencil.</p>

<p>Then his tongue had to be between his lips, else how
could he write?</p>

<p>Bob, as we know, had another peculiar habit; he could
not think without scratching his head.</p>

<p>So, taken altogether, writing was an arduous undertaking.</p>

<p>After several attempts, Bob declared himself satisfied
with his effusion.</p>

<p>It was as peculiar as the writer himself. Some of the
letters were printed, and gave the missive a very strange
appearance, especially when the printed letter came in
the middle of a word.</p>

<p>"He made me swear not to tell," the letter commenced,
"or your hair would stand on end."</p>

<p>Bob scratched his head as he read it.</p>

<p>"That's good!" he murmured. "I ain't splitting."</p>

<p>His spelling was as bad as his writing, but those little
mistakes we have rectified, as it is with the subject matter,
not the correctness of the orthography or chirography,
that we have to deal.</p>

<p>"But if I dare tell you, you'd put all the prisoners in
irons before the night got dark, and there may be bullets
underneath the tin. Your boy, Bob."</p>

<p>When perfectly satisfied with the epistle, Bob began
to wonder how he could give it to Tempest without the
act being seen.</p>

<p>After considerable head scratching, he put the paper on
Tempest's plate, the dinner table being set.</p>

<p>Then he stood outside the cabin to watch whether the
letter reached its proper destination.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MUTINY QUELLED.</p>


<p>Lieutenant Tempest saw the paper as soon as he entered
the cabin, and was very much inclined to resent the placing
of dirty paper on his dinner plate.</p>

<p>But when he saw Bob's signature, he became amused.</p>

<p>He was about to throw the document away, when Bob
shouted from the outside:</p>

<p>"Read it, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! You there, Bob? What is it? Want more grog,
or extra biscuits, or is it something you want for Mr.
Scarron?"</p>

<p>Bob happened to see Luiga nearby, and knew that the
West Indian was listening.</p>

<p>"Yes, cap'n," he answered, "the doctor sent me for
some, and I didn't see you, so I wrote it down."</p>

<p>Tempest glanced over the paper, and saw at once that
Bob was acting very diplomatically.</p>

<p>"Will you ask the doctor to see me about it? He had
better come at once."</p>

<p>Luiga heard Tempest's remark and felt easier.</p>

<p>"Thought he had split. If he had I would have slit his
throat for him before he was an hour older."</p>

<p>Tempest was alone.</p>

<p>"What does he mean?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>"'He made me swear.' Who did? 'Make my hair
stand on end,' 'put prisoners in irons before night got
dark'&mdash;really, Bob, your composition is an enigma. 'Bullets
may be under the tin.' It is a conundrum hard to
read."</p>

<p>The doctor entered at that moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob had sense enough to see that he was suspected by
Luiga, and so he must remove that suspicion and trust to
Tempest to find an excuse for the English doctor.</p>

<p>Luiga was close to the cabin when the doctor entered,
and all his suspicions vanished when he heard Tempest
say:</p>

<p>"Ah, doctor! Bob has been trying to make me understand
what you want for poor Scarron. A doctor's prescription
is usually hard to read, but Bob's is worse."</p>

<p>It so happened that the doctor had really commissioned
Bob to ask Tempest for an extra allowance of grog for
Scarron.</p>

<p>The English doctor was one of the garrulous kind, who
gloried in the sound of his own voice.</p>

<p>"Smart boy, that Bob. I should say he is a real good
fellow."</p>

<p>"Yes, as true as steel, though no great friend of your
nation, doctor."</p>

<p>Luiga stayed no longer.</p>

<p>He was satisfied that Bob had not betrayed him.</p>

<p>The doctor stayed and chatted for half an hour, and
Tempest enjoyed the change, for it was a pleasure to have
an educated man as companion out on the open seas.</p>

<p>But all the time that the disciple of Esculapius was talking
the lieutenant was puzzling his brain to know what
Bob really meant.</p>

<p>"Place all the prisoners in irons. That seems harsh.
Shall I do it, or shall I question Bob first?"</p>

<p>The latter course was resolved upon, and Bob was duly
cross-examined; but he was true to his oath, although he
evaded the strict spirit by saying:</p>

<p>"If I hadn't sworn not to tell you, cap'n, I should say
that there would be mutiny the first dark night; but I
did swear not to tell you, so cannot say it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>No diplomat ever got around a difficult problem easier
than did Bob, and Tempest saw that the powder-monkey
had some secret information which he could not make
public.</p>

<p>The day passed on as most days do when the sea is
calm and the sky unruffled by even a cloud, and Tempest
hesitated on his course of action.</p>

<p>If the <i>Lively Bee</i> had been nearer he would have sought
advice from his captain, but that meant delay, and action
must be taken at once.</p>

<p>It was better to be on the safe side, and he had resolved
to imprison the men, when a sail was sighted.</p>

<p>That gave him the excuse he wanted.</p>

<p>The prisoners were ordered on deck, and, as they stood
in line, Tempest saw an ominous scowl on more than one
face.</p>

<p>"Men, I have sent for you to thank you for your behavior
during the time you have been prisoners of war,"
he began, and the men wondered at such a novel introduction.
"I have always believed in human nature, and still
do so, but there are times when prudence demands certain
precautions to be taken. A sail appears on the horizon,
and we may have to fight; therefore, it becomes necessary
to order you below until all danger has passed."</p>

<p>Luiga scowled and looked threateningly at Tempest.</p>

<p>"You'll place us in irons next, eh?"</p>

<p>"If it is necessary, yes," answered Tempest without a
quiver in his voice.</p>

<p>"Then you'll get no chance with me. I'm a free man,
and so are we all&mdash;eh, men?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Luiga!"</p>

<p>"Then I say I'll be your cap'n, and there ain't men
enough on this ship to say me nay. Will you stand by
me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Luiga, we will."</p>

<p>"Seize him," cried Luiga, pointing to Tempest, who
had stood calmly and stoically during the mutinous language.</p>

<p>But as soon as Luiga gave the order, he quietly raised
his pistol and shot the West Indian dead.</p>

<p>Drawing his sword, he challenged the mutineers to come
on and he would meet them single handed.</p>

<p>"No, no, we were wrong. We ain't murderers nor
mutineers, we're fighters," said one, and his speech was
echoed by the others.</p>

<p>"Tell me Luiga's plot and I will believe your honesty."</p>

<p>The spokesman told of the intended mutiny, and, to
Tempest's surprise, told him that Luiga was always hinting
that the boxes of tin contained bullets as well as that
valuable commodity.</p>

<p>Although Tempest appeared to trust the men, he kept
them under close surveillance.</p>

<p>Curiosity led him to have one of the boxes of tin
opened, and, to his great surprise and joy, he found that
under the sheets of tin there were hundreds of sovereigns,
doubtless intended for the British paymaster-general.</p>

<p>Such a discovery was too important to be concealed
from the <i>Lively Bee</i>, and early the next morning Captain
Vernon was signaled, and put off in a boat for the <i>Regina</i>.</p>

<p>Tempest told Vernon of his suspicion, and a general
overhauling of the cargo resulted in the finding of over
a hundred thousand pounds sterling.</p>

<p>The cargo was consigned to Thomas Arbuthnot, and
Vernon remembered that the paymaster of the English
army bore that name.</p>

<p>It was the richest prize taken during the war, and Vernon
declared that if he was allowed to keep the prize he
would quit privateering, and settle down on shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>All speed was made to land, and Vernon reported his
capture to the government.</p>

<p>He was allowed to keep his prize, and so all the crew
of the <i>Lively Bee</i> shared in the prize money, the amount
of which almost took away their breath.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">VERNON'S SUCCESS.</p>


<p>Intoxicated with success, the crew of the <i>Lively Bee</i>
urged Vernon to make one more voyage.</p>

<p>But he had given his word that he would retire, and
though only to himself, it was binding.</p>

<p>"I would like the <i>Lively Bee</i> to make another cruise,"
he said, "and if Lieutenant Tempest will take command
I shall be delighted."</p>

<p>Tempest was still thirsting for glory, and accepted the
offer.</p>

<p>"Go, my friend!" said Vernon, as the new captain of
the <i>Lively Bee</i> was leaving Baltimore to join the famous
privateer&mdash;"go, bring back prizes if you can, act with
honor, as I know you will, but above all remember that I
would rather hear that the <i>Lively Bee</i> was at the bottom
of the sea than that she was captured by the British."</p>

<p>A number of privateers were in the Chesapeake Bay at
the time, and many friends of the crews had assembled
on the docks.</p>

<p>Those who heard the speech of Vernon cheered lustily.</p>

<p>"Never give up the ship!" cried one old salt.</p>

<p>"No, that I swear!" assented Tempest, solemnly.</p>

<p>Among those who watched the departure of the gallant
privateersman stood Bertha Tempest and Pauline Jones.</p>

<p>Bertha's eyes were red, for she had parted again with
the husband she so loved, while a glad light shone from
the flashing orbs of Pauline.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was caused by the fact that Captain Harry
Vernon&mdash;"Handsome Harry," as he was called in Washington&mdash;was
to return to the Capital City with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Vernon was wealthy.</p>

<p>Not according to our ideas of wealth to-day, for we
reckon riches to mean away up in the millions, whereas
a man with two hundred thousand dollars in those days
was looked upon as a veritable prodigy of wealth.</p>

<p>Harry Vernon had considerably over a hundred thousand
dollars, and was well content with his fortune.</p>

<p>The <i>Lively Bee</i> had left the city, and was far out of
sight.</p>

<p>In her track followed the <i>True-blooded Yankee</i> of Boston
and the <i>Lovely Lass</i> of Salem, both first-class privateers,
and both with records hard to beat.</p>

<p>Then came that fast-cruising schooner, <i>Jack's Favorite</i>,
specially commissioned to search for the <i>Essex</i>, which had
not been heard from for some time.</p>

<p>As Vernon saw them leave with all their wealth of canvas,
a sigh escaped him.</p>

<p>Already he was secretly planning again for life on the
ocean wave.</p>

<p>But when he looked at the sweet face of Pauline Jones,
he felt that there was a harbor in which he would like to
rest&mdash;a haven of peace if she did but share it with him.</p>

<p>Intrepid in war, fearless in the angriest storm, he yet
was a very coward in her presence; for, although he loved
her with an ardor amounting almost to worship, he was
too bashful to tell of his love.</p>

<p>Perhaps the story would never have been told had not
Bertha helped him.</p>

<p>And when, with blushing face and almost stammering
tongue, Pauline admitted that Vernon was her ideal of
bravery and courage, and that she admired him, he was
so elated that Washington did not seem large enough for
him to call his home.</p>

<p>But before the secret was known and Vernon's suspense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
ended, several weeks had passed, and the year had ripened
into spring, and the buds and blossoms had developed into
summer fruit and flowers.</p>

<p>No tidings had been received of the <i>Lively Bee</i>, and
Bertha was beginning to feel uneasy; her face was getting
wan, her eyes were losing their luster.</p>

<p>Great excitement was of daily experience; sometimes
the news making the people hilarious with joy, and at
others plunging them into the depths of despair.</p>

<p>Washington was in mourning for the loss of Lawrence,
who, though wounded, had shouted to his men:</p>

<p>"Never give up the ship!"</p>

<p>The <i>Chesapeake</i> had been captured by the <i>Shannon</i>,
and brave Lawrence's dead body reposed in Canadian soil.</p>

<p>Then came the news of disasters on land, and the prospects
were dark for the young Republic.</p>

<p>The patriotic soul of Harry Vernon was chafing at idleness,
and he had almost resolved to fit out another privateer,
but was persuaded to wait a little longer for news
of the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>Then came news of the <i>Essex</i>, and all the country was
filled with the praises of Captain Porter, who had captured
so many British vessels.</p>

<p>But while according so much praise to Porter, they did
not fail to mete out their approbation of the courage of
the young midshipman, Farragut, who, though a boy in
years, had been given the command of the captured ship,
<i>Barclay</i>.</p>

<p>All Washington was reading Farragut's letter home.</p>

<p>"I was sent as prize-master to the <i>Barclay</i>," he wrote.
"This was an important event in my life; and when it
was decided that I was to take the ship to Valparaiso, I
felt no little pride at finding myself in command, at twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
years of age. The <i>Barclay</i> had been recaptured from a
Spanish <i>guarda costa</i>. The captain and his mate were on
board; and I was to control the men sent from our frigate,
while the captain was to navigate the vessel. When Captain
Porter ordered us to proceed to Valparaiso, the captain
of the <i>Barclay</i>, a violent-tempered old fellow, was
furious.</p>

<p>"He told me that he should take the <i>Barclay</i> where he
pleased, but never to Valparaiso.</p>

<p>"I considered that my day of trial had come, for I was
a little afraid of the old fellow, as every one else was.
But the time had come for me at least to play the man,
so I mustered up courage and informed the captain that
I desired the topsail filled away.</p>

<p>"He replied that he would shoot any man who dared to
touch a rope without his orders; he 'would go his own
course, and had no idea of trusting himself with a nut-shell'&mdash;meaning
me. And then he went below for his
pistols.</p>

<p>"I called my right-hand man of the crew, and told him
my situation; I also informed him that I wanted the main
topsail filled.</p>

<p>"He answered with a clear 'Ay, ay, sir!' in a manner
which was not to be misunderstood, and my confidence
was perfectly restored.</p>

<p>"From that moment I became master of the vessel, and
immediately gave all necessary orders for making sail,
notifying the captain not to come on deck with his pistols
unless he wished to go overboard; for I would really have
had little trouble in having such an order obeyed."</p>

<p>We can readily understand how such a letter would
arouse the people to a frenzy of excitement.</p>

<p>And thus, in alternate enthusiasm and depression, the
months passed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>The people had not realized what war meant, they had
not yet faced the dread monster, as in a few months they
were destined to do&mdash;when the British marched into their
city and burned the Capitol and the White House.</p>

<p>That was not dreamed of then, and the people feasted
only on the news of distant conflict.</p>

<p>"If the war does not end by the New Year," said Vernon
to Bertha Tempest, "I shall fit out another privateer."</p>

<p>"What would Pauline say?"</p>

<p>"Would she care?"</p>

<p>"Ask her."</p>

<p>"Bertha, you raise my hopes&mdash;why do you speak like
that? You know something&mdash;does she care for me?"</p>

<p>"Why not ask her?"</p>

<p>"If I did and was repulsed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if you were not!"</p>

<p>"I will ask her. I will be bold. I will go on my knees
and say: 'Pauline, I love you, will you be my wife?' and
then if she repulses me, I shall&mdash;shall go to the war and
not care what becomes of me."</p>

<p>"But if she says yes?"</p>

<p>Vernon was startled, for the question was asked by
Pauline, who had entered unobserved.</p>

<p>"You heard?" asked Vernon, half idiotically, for unless
she had heard she could not have asked him the question.</p>

<p>"Of course I heard what you said, you silly, conceited
fellow!"</p>

<p>"And your answer?"</p>

<p>"Any one but you knew what it would be months ago."</p>

<p>"You mean it&mdash;you do love me?"</p>

<p>It is needless saying what answers were given to Vernon's
questions.</p>

<p>Bertha had withdrawn and left the young people together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
and the hours slipped by, to them uncounted and
unheeded.</p>

<p>When Bertha did re-enter the room, Vernon exclaimed,
with all the enthusiasm of a schoolboy:</p>

<p>"Bertha, we are to be married in two weeks; isn't it too
bad that Pauline wants to wait so long?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE END OF THE LIVELY BEE.</p>


<p>The marriage of Harry Vernon with the daughter of
Colonel Jones was an event of note in Washington society.
No matter how quiet the contracting parties wished
it to be, the people said, "No."</p>

<p>Vernon was a public man. He belonged to the public,
and his marriage must be a public one.</p>

<p>Such was the verdict of society, and to its edict he had
to bow.</p>

<p>The ceremony was but halfway through when a man,
wan and weary looking, entered the church and took a
seat in the rear pew.</p>

<p>None seemed to recognize him until the bride, leaning
on her husband's arm, was nearly opposite him.</p>

<p>Then the groom turned, and with a glad shout left his
wife and clasped the stranger's hand.</p>

<p>"Tempest! My dear fellow, you don't know how glad
I am to see you."</p>

<p>But there was another equally&mdash;nay, if possible more&mdash;glad,
and that was the loving Bertha.</p>

<p>She did not faint.</p>

<p>She was made of heroic stuff, and while she rested her
head on her husband's shoulder she whispered her congratulations
on his return.</p>

<p>"But you are ill. You look so poorly."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, but I am alive, and to be with you will be
better than medicine or physician's skill."</p>

<p>At the wedding feast the honored guest was John
Tempest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>All were waiting for his story, all knew that there
would be sadness in its recital.</p>

<p>Only one question had Vernon asked.</p>

<p>"What of the <i>Lively Bee</i>?"</p>

<p>And Tempest had answered:</p>

<p>"At the bottom of the sea. All lost save honor."</p>

<p>Then the story was told.</p>

<p>"The <i>Lively Bee</i> had reached the roadstead of Fayal.
The neutral flag of Portugal floated from its citadel, and
I thought we were safe.</p>

<p>"But while we were lying in the port, getting fresh
provisions and repainting, a British squadron, composed
of the <i>Plantagenet</i>, seventy-four guns; the <i>Rota</i>, thirty-eight,
and <i>Carnation</i>, eighteen, hove in sight.</p>

<p>"The governor of Fayal sent for me and said he was
too weak in military forces to protect me, so I must take
my chance.</p>

<p>"At night four barges, let fall from the enemy's ships,
each manned by forty men, made toward us.</p>

<p>"I ordered to beat to quarters, and when my men were
at their posts I shouted:</p>

<p>"'What boat is that? Answer or I'll fire.'</p>

<p>"You know I had four guns, as well as the long one,
and when the British refused to answer I ordered a
broadside to be fired.</p>

<p>"The carnage was terrible, for my gunners kept loading
and firing with astonishing rapidity.</p>

<p>"So hot was the reception they got that the barges returned
to the ships.</p>

<p>"But another barge had come up on the leeward, and
we were boarded almost before we knew anything about it.</p>

<p>"'Come on, my lads,' I shouted, 'and we'll drive them
into the sea.'</p>

<p>"My men fought so desperately that we did drive them
into the sea, and the remaining boats put back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was not to be expected that we should escape.</p>

<p>"I ordered the long gun to be loaded and pointed down
the hatch.</p>

<p>"When morning came the enemy had closed in upon us
and the time had come when we must either destroy the
<i>Lively Bee</i> or give her up to the English.</p>

<p>"'Haul down that rag,' shouted the captain of the
<i>Plantagenet</i>, pointing to the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>"'Never,' I answered, and my men cheered lustily.</p>

<p>"I saw the boats put off, manned with boarders, and I
knew the hour had come.</p>

<p>"With my own hand I applied the match, and a ball
went crashing through the bottom of the <i>Lively Bee</i>.</p>

<p>"Then I applied the torch, and a column of flame rose
up to the clouds, and told the British that we could die
but never surrender.</p>

<p>"We leaped into the water and all the crew reached the
island, where we were safe under the neutral flag.</p>

<p>"We could not get any vessel to bear us away, for the
British would have pursued and captured the vessel in
order to secure us.</p>

<p>"So we stayed there, almost in a starving condition, for
three months, until the coast was clear and we managed
to get away.</p>

<p>"We have all returned&mdash;all save Mullen&mdash;he too rests
at the bottom of the sea with the vessel he loved so much.</p>

<p>"We have lost all, but we did what we could."</p>

<p>Tempest's eyes were moist with tears as he finished his
story.</p>

<p>Vernon clasped his hand.</p>

<p>"No, you have not lost all. A nation thanks you for
your work. A nation places the laurel crown on your
brow, for you saved the flag; you lost your ship but you
saved your honor&mdash;your country's honor, and in that defeat
you are greater than if you had gained a victory."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have not lost all," exclaimed Bertha. "You have
a loving wife and faithful friends."</p>

<p>"And I thank Heaven that I have fought for my country
and never surrendered its flag," added Tempest, as he
resumed his seat.</p>

<p>Congress thanked Vernon and Tempest for their patriotic

<h2>The Famous Frank Merriwell Stories.</h2>

<h3>BURT L. STANDISH.</h3>

<p>No modern series of tales for boys and youths has met with anything
like the cordial reception and popularity accorded to the Frank
Merriwell Stories. There must be a reason for this and there is.

honest, courageous American lad, who appeals to the hearts of the
boys. He has no bad habits, and his manliness inculcates the idea
that it is not necessary for a boy to indulge in petty vices to be a hero.
Frank Merriwell's example is a shining light for every ambitious lad
to follow. Twenty volumes now ready:</p>
